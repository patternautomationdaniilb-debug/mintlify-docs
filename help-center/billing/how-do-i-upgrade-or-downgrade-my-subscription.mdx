#### **Upgrading Your Subscription**

You can upgrade your plan anytime by clicking the **Upgrade** button.\
If you're using the Lemon AI , go to the **Account** panel at the bottom left and select **Upgrade** or **Credits** to access your subscription page.

#### **How does the system charge me when I upgrade?**

**If you subscribed through Stripe**

When you upgrade on the website, you just need to select the new plan and pay the price difference. Once the payment goes through, you’ll immediately receive the credits from the upgraded plan.\
Your next billing date will also reset based on the day you upgraded.

**How the upgrade fee is calculated:**\
**Upgrade Fee = New Plan Price – Remaining Credit Value from Current Plan**

**Example: Upgrading from Monthly Pro to Monthly Business**

* Monthly Business Price: **$99.00**
* Remaining credits in your account: **18,592 credits**, equal to **$18.59**
* Amount to pay: **$99.00 – $18.59 = $80.41**

If you subscribed to the Monthly Pro plan on the 1st and upgraded to Monthly Business on the 15th, you only pay **$80.41**. You’ll immediately receive **99,000 credits**, and your next renewal date becomes the **15th of next month**.

***

**If you upgrade through WeChat Pay**

Simply choose the new plan and pay the price difference. Once the payment is completed, the upgraded credits will be added to your account right away.

For now, WeChat Pay does **not** support auto-renewal.\
Your membership expiration date will be recalculated based on your upgrade date.

**Upgrade Fee = New Plan Price – Remaining Credit Value from Current Plan**

**Example: Upgrading from Monthly Pro to Monthly Business**

* Monthly Business Price: **$99.00**
* Remaining credits: **18,592 credits = $18.59**
* Amount due: **$99.00 – $18.59 = $80.41**

If you subscribed to Monthly Pro on the 1st and upgraded on the 15th, you’ll pay **$80.41**, get **99,000 credits immediately**, and your Business plan will expire on the **15th of next month**.

***

#### **Will a downgrade take effect immediately?**

No. Downgrades do **not** take effect right away.\
Lemon AI will apply your downgraded plan at your **next billing cycle**.

**Example:**\
If you subscribed to Monthly Business on the 1st and choose to downgrade to Monthly Pro on the 15th, you’ll keep all Business benefits until your next renewal on the **1st of next month**. After that, your plan will automatically renew as Monthly Pro.
