### Frequently Asked Questions

**How is Enterprise different from standard NeuroAI?**

Enterprise includes dedicated implementation services, advanced security features, custom integrations, SLA guarantees, and white-glove support. Standard NeuroAI is self-service for smaller teams.

**What integrations do you support?**

We integrate with all major enterprise systems including Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics, ServiceNow, Workday, and custom APIs. If you have a unique system, we'll build the integration.

**How long does implementation take?**

Most enterprise deployments are live within 4-6 weeks. Complex environments with extensive custom requirements may take 8-10 weeks.

**What's included in the implementation service?**

Discovery workshops, custom configuration, system integrations, security setup, user training, documentation, and 90 days of post-launch optimization support.

**Do you offer industry-specific solutions?**

Yes. We have specialized expertise in healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, technology, and professional services with pre-built compliance frameworks.

**Can we start with a pilot program?**

Absolutely. Many enterprise customers begin with a department-level pilot before scaling organization-wide. We'll design a pilot program that demonstrates ROI quickly.

**What happens after implementation?**

You'll have ongoing access to our support team, quarterly business reviews with your success manager, and continuous optimization to expand your automation capabilities.
