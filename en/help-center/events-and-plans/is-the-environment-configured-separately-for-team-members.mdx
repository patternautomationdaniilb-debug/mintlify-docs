Each team member is allocated an independent workspace that is inaccessible to other team members. This configuration ensures that all tasks, files, and activities within an individual member's workspace remain confidential, facilitating focused work without external interference. Such an arrangement promotes privacy and enhances productivity by allowing members to manage their responsibilities autonomously.
