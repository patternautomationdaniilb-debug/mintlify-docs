**Introduction to automatic invitation acceptance**

When Single Sign-On (SSO) is enabled for your Team, the process of onboarding new members becomes significantly more efficient. Invited users are no longer required to find and click on an email invitation link to join your team. Instead, they are automatically added to the Team workspace upon their first successful login using their SSO credentials. This feature simplifies the user journey, reduces administrative friction, and ensures that new team members can get to work right away.

**How It Works:**

The automated invitation acceptance process is seamless for both administrators and new users.

1. Administrator Invites User:

   A team administrator sends an invitation to a new user's email address through the team management dashboard.
2. User Login:

   Navigate to the login page and enter your email address.
3. SSO Authentication:

   After logging in with your credentials, user is brought to the SSO authentication page to complete authentication.
4. Automatic redirection:

   User will automatically land on the Manus Team workspace upon successful SSO authentication.

This process eliminates the risk of invitation emails being lost or overlooked, ensuring a more reliable onboarding experience.

**Troubleshooting**

If a user is not automatically added to the team after SSO login, please check the following:

- Correct Email Address: Ensure that the invitation was sent to the primary email address associated with the user's SSO account.
- SSO Enabled: Verify that SSO is fully enabled and correctly configured for your team.
- Pending Invitation: Confirm that the invitation is still active and has not expired or been revoked.

### **Inviting people who are not in their verified domains**

Once SSO is enforced, you can still invite people who are not in their verified domains (e.g., external collaborators). We have additional configurations in the SSO tab that dictate how people can log in.

#### **Additional configurations (How to add new member):**

1. **No restriction**
2. **Only through new SSO login**
3. **Only through admin invitation**
