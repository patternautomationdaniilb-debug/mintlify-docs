I believe the following information will be helpful to you:

Neuro official has created some good <u>use cases</u> (you can see Neuro's capabilities and potential areas for innovation).

We have also compiled some impressive official webpages and dashboards from Neuro.

Neuro credits are units that measure system resource usage. Each interaction with Neuro consumes a certain amount of credits, depending on the complexity of the task. You can learn more about credits through this link.

We will update any future activities in Discord. You can join our Discord community(soon) through this link to stay informed. Thank you for your support.
