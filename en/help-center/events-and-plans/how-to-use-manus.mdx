I believe the following information will be helpful to you:

[<u>Examples</u>](https://manus.im/usecase-from-user) of how other users are using Manus.

Manus official has created some good [<u>use cases</u>](https://manus.im/usecase-gallery) (you can see Manus's capabilities and potential areas for innovation).

We have also compiled some impressive [<u>official webpages and dashboards</u>](https://manus.im/space-gallery) from Manus.

Manus credits are units that measure system resource usage. Each interaction with Manus consumes a certain amount of credits, depending on the complexity of the task. You can learn more about credits through this [<u>link</u>](https://manus.im/help/credits).

We will update any future activities in Discord. You can join our [<u>Discord community</u>](https://discord.gg/7ywuh9bAYy) through this link to stay informed. Thank you for your support.
