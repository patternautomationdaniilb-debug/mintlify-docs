**Introduction**

To support larger organizations in maintaining a high level of security and simplifying user management, we are pleased to offer our Single Sign-On (SSO) feature free of charge for all teams with 30 or more members. This initiative is designed to make secure authentication accessible to growing teams, allowing them to integrate their existing identity providers without incurring additional costs. The primary benefit is enhanced security at scale, coupled with a more streamlined login experience for all team members.

**Types of subscription**

There are currently 2 different types of SSO Manus Team subscription - if your Manus Team subscription is:

1. 30 or more seats, your SSO subscription (which is a flat fee of 150 USD + tax) will be free of charge.

2. Below 30 seats, your SSO subscription will be charged a flat fee of 150 USD + tax.

_\*Please note that if you have already purchased the SSO subscription, and the Team seats increase to 30 people after that, then it will only be free from the next SSO billing cycle onwards._
