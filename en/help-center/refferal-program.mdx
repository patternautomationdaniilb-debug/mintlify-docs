## Reward Structure

| Friend purchases Ultra (9,990₽/month) | \+1,000 |

### Monthly Recurring Rewards (While Friend is Subscribed)

These credits are awarded every month as long as your friend maintains their subscription:

| Event                                     | Credits/Month |
| :---------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| Friend subscribed to Plus (990₽/month)    | \+100         |

## Fraud Protection & Safety Rules

To maintain program integrity and prevent abuse, we have implemented two key protection mechanisms:

### Rule 1: Rate Limiting (20 Referrals per 24 Hours)

**Maximum Referrals:** 20 referrals per 24-hour period

**Action if Exceeded:** Automatic temporary ban for 24 hours. No new referral invites can be sent during this period.

**Why:** Prevents automated bot attacks and ensures genuine human referrals only.

---

### Rule 2: Conditional Bonus with 14-Day Requirement

#### The Bonus Offer

```
🎁 Get 1,000 Credits NOW!
Condition: Invite at least 1 friend within 14 days
```

#### What Happens if You Don't Complete the Condition

- **Day 15:** If you haven't invited at least 1 friend, we automatically deduct **500 credits** from your referral earnings
- This ensures the bonus is only for active participants who genuinely try to grow the community

#### Why This Rule Exists

- Ensures users are actively engaged in the referral program
- Prevents casual or inactive users from claiming rewards they didn't earn
- Creates accountability and encourages real growth

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do my friends know I invited them?

No. Your referral is tracked through the link, but friends won't see that YOU specifically referred them. They just know they came from a NeuroAI referral link.

### Can I earn credits forever?

Yes! As long as your friends maintain their subscriptions, you earn monthly credits. There's no limit.

### What if my friend cancels their subscription?

You stop earning monthly credits for that friend. However, you keep the one-time bonus you earned when they first purchased.

### Can I use referral credits to buy a subscription?

Yes! Referral credits work exactly like purchased credits. You can use them to pay for any plan or feature.

### What if I refer the same person twice?

We track by email. If the same email address registers twice, only the first referral counts. We do this to prevent fraud.

### Do referral credits expire?

No, they don't expire. As long as you maintain some activity in NeuroAI (logging in, using features), your credits remain valid.

### What's the 20-referral limit per 24 hours?

This is a safety measure to prevent bot attacks. If you try to send more than 20 referral invites in one day, you'll be temporarily blocked for 24 hours.

### Why do I lose 500 credits if I don't invite anyone in 14 days?

The 1,000-credit bonus requires engagement. We deduct 500 credits if you don't complete the condition to ensure the program rewards active participants only.

### Can I refer someone already using NeuroAI?

No, they must be new to NeuroAI. If they already have an account, the referral won't count.
