**Introduction**

Our platform offers an intelligent routing feature that automatically places you into your Team after you log in with your Single Sign-On (SSO). This eliminates the need for manual workspace selection, allowing you to access your team's workspace immediately after logging in.

- _Please note that SSO captures users based on the email domain (\*\*\*@_**_.\*\*\*_**) they use for login, and that your domain can only be claimed by one organization. The SSO process will automatically land you in precisely one team’s SSO configuration, depending on who claimed the email domain you use.

**How It Works: A Step-by-Step Guide**

1. Initiate Login: Navigate to the login page and enter your email address.
2. SSO Authentication: After logging in with your credentials, user is brought to the SSO authentication page to complete authentication.
3. Automatic redirection: User will automatically land on the Neuro Team workspace upon successful SSO authentication.

_\*No additional steps are required from the user. The system handles the entire redirection process in the background._

**Troubleshooting**

If you are not automatically redirected to your team's workspace after logging in, please consider the following:

- Incorrect SSO Configuration: Your team's administrator should verify that the SSO configuration is correctly set up and that your user profile is properly mapped within the identity provider.
- Browser Cache Issues: Try clearing your browser's cache and cookies, as outdated session information can sometimes interfere with the redirection process.
