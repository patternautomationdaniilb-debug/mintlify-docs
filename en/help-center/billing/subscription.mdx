## **Upgrade/Downgrade subscription**

You can directly click on the subscription purchase interface to upgrade to a higher-level subscription or downgrade your membership subscription. To upgrade via the Neuro app, navigate to your **Account** page and select **Manage Subscription** on Billing Page to access your subscription settings.

Currently, Neuro **does not support cross-platform operations**. You need to proceed to the platform where you first subscribed to perform the corresponding operation.

**For example:**

- Mobile version
  - If you subscribed through Apple, you also need to complete subscription upgrades through Apple
  - If you subscribed through Google, you also need to complete subscription upgrades through Google
- Web version
  - If you subscribed through Stripe or Yookassa, you also need to complete subscription upgrades through Stripe or Yookassa

### How will upgrading my subscription charge my credits?

### **You subscribed via Stripe or Yookassa**

Please note that we will calculate the upgrade amount based on time proportions without changing the subscription cycle, and the system will compensate you for the credits difference between the two plans.

**For example**, if you subscribed to the \$25 Pro monthly plan on the 1st of the month, and then upgraded to the \$99 Ultra monthly plan on the 15th, you would only need to pay the \$25 difference and immediately receive the corresponding credits. Your \$99 Ultra monthly plan will then renew on the 1st of the following month.

### **You subscribed via Apple Subscriptions**

When upgrading a subscription order on the Apple platform, the original order will be automatically refunded, and the upgraded subscription order will be charged at the full price.

### **You subscribed via Google Play Store**

When upgrading your subscription on an Android device, you need to pay the full price of the new plan. Any remaining credits from your previous plan will be added to your new billing cycle, and the unused membership days from your previous plan will be converted into additional days for your new subscription based on the price ratio between the plans.

**For example,** if you subscribed to a \$25 Pro monthly plan on June 1st with 3,000 credits, and then upgraded to a \$99 Ultra monthly plan on June 6th, you would need to pay \$25 and receive credits corresponding to the price difference. Your existing 3,000 credits would also be retained and added to your new plan. The \$99 Ultra monthly plan period will be the same as the \$25 Pro monthly plan period.

### **Low-price annual plan upgrade to high-price monthly plan**

- Mobile users will not receive refunds for price differences, only membership time extension
- Web user : Please note that we will calculate the upgrade amount based on time proportion, and the subscription cycle will also change accordingly. The system will calculate the corresponding refund amount or the difference you need to pay. If your upgraded plan amount is greater than the original annual plan amount, you will need to pay the difference. (The refund amount will be returned to your Stripe account)

### **Will downgrade take effect immediately?**

Downgrades do not take effect immediately. Currently, Neuro handles subscription downgrades by applying them at your next renewal cycle.

**For example**, if you subscribed to a \$99 Ultra monthly plan on the 1st of this month and chose to downgrade to a \$25 Pro monthly plan on the 15th, you will retain the \$99 Ultra monthly plan subscription benefits until the next renewal date on the 1st of next month. At that time, your subscription will renew as a \$25 Pro monthly plan.
