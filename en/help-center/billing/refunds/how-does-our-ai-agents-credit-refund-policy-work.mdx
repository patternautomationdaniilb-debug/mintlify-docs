### **Understanding Our Credit Refund Policy**

At Neuro, we use a credit system to enable our AI agents to perform a wide range of tasks on your behalf. We are committed to ensuring that this system is fair and transparent. This article explains how our credit refund policy works, including the process for requesting a refund and the circumstances under which refunds are issued.

Our primary goal is to provide a reliable and effective service. If our platform fails to deliver due to a technical issue on our end, we believe you are entitled to a refund for the credits used on that task. All refund requests are carefully reviewed by a specialized AI agent and our Customer Success team to ensure a fair and consistent evaluation.

### **When Credit Refunds Are Issued**

We will issue a full credit refund for a task if our investigation confirms that the issue was caused by a verifiable bug or platform malfunction. Our commitment is to ensure you only pay for tasks that are processed correctly by our systems.

**What qualifies as a bug?**

A bug is a technical error or fault in the Neuro platform that prevents the AI agent from completing a task as expected or causes it to behave in an unintended way.

Examples of situations where a refund will be issued:

- **Platform Error:** The AI agent fails to execute a task due to an internal server error, a tool malfunction, or an unexpected system crash.
- **Tool Misuse:** The AI agent uses a tool incorrectly in a way that directly violates its documented instructions, leading to task failure.
- **Incomplete Execution:** The AI agent stops mid-task without a valid reason (e.g., not due to hitting a limit or receiving a user stop command) and fails to deliver any results.

We sincerely apologize for any unpleasant experiences you may have encountered while using Neuro.

AI-generated content may not always meet 100% satisfaction as different users have varying standards. You can provide instructions to Neuro based on your goals and needs to generate corresponding content, and then continuously adjust and refine the output.

If you describe your requirements as precisely as possible at the very beginning of a conversation, it can help reduce the overall context length and credit consumption. A small tip for minimizing credit consumption: issuing more detailed, clear, and less ambiguous instructions and descriptions to Neuro might help you achieve your desired results more quickly.

### **When Credit Refunds Are Not Issued**

While we aim to be fair, we cannot issue refunds for situations that fall outside the scope of a platform malfunction. This includes issues related to user-provided instructions, subjective satisfaction with the outcome, or the inherent limitations of AI.

Refunds are generally not issued in the following circumstances:

| Scenario                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Change of Mind             | You decide you no longer need the task completed after the AI agent has already started or finished the work. Credits are consumed as the agent works, and this work cannot be undone.       |
| Unclear Instructions       | Your instructions were ambiguous, contradictory, or incomplete, leading the AI agent to make a reasonable interpretation that did not align with your unstated expectations.                 |
| Subjective Dissatisfaction | The AI agent completed the task as requested, but you are not satisfied with the creative or subjective aspects of the outcome (e.g., writing style, design choice, or analytical approach). |
| External Factors           | The task fails due to issues with third-party websites, APIs, or services that are beyond Neuro's control (e.g., a website is down, an external API returns an error).                       |
| Hitting Task Limits        | The task was stopped because it reached a predefined safety or resource/knowledge base limit, which is a standard operational procedure.                                                     |

We encourage users to provide clear, specific, and detailed instructions to ensure the best possible outcome for their tasks.

### **The AI-Powered Refund Review Process**

To ensure fairness and accuracy, all credit refund requests are handled by a specialized AI agent that is trained to analyze task execution logs. This process is designed to be objective and thorough.

**How It Works**

1. Request Submission: You submit/imply a refund request for a specific task and share a task link with us. To share your conversation/task link with us, you may refer to the screenshots below:
2. AI Review Initiated: Our system assigns your request to a review AI. This AI is granted temporary, read-only access to the complete execution history of the specified task, including all steps, tool inputs/outputs, and system logs.
3. Thorough Analysis: The AI agent meticulously reviews the entire task history to identify any anomalies, errors, or deviations from expected behavior. It cross-references the agent's actions with our internal tool documentation and platform health logs to determine if a bug occurred.
4. Decision: Based on its analysis, the AI makes a determination. If a bug is confirmed, a credit refund is processed automatically to your account.

**Please Be Patient During the Review**

This comprehensive review process is highly detailed and can take some time to complete. The AI agent must analyze potentially thousands of data points to make an accurate and fair decision.

We kindly ask for your patience while our AI agent completes its review. Rushing the process could lead to an inaccurate conclusion. You will be notified as soon as the review is complete and a decision has been made.
