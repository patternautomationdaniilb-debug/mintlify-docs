Due to various factors, including costs, commercial pricing has been implemented during the testing phase. In the future, we may optimize and adjust the pricing.

Considering operational costs and fairness to all users, we are unable to provide additional free credits to individual users. For details on how credits are consumed, [<u>this link</u>](https://manus.im/help/credits) should help you understand.

To provide a better trial experience, we currently offer a free version. For free users, we provide 1,000 credits to every new user upon registration, and 300 daily credits will be refreshed for free every day.

You can find more details on the subscription page.
