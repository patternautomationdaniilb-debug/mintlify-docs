Due to various factors, including costs, commercial pricing has been implemented during the testing phase. In the future, we may optimize and adjust the pricing.

Considering operational costs and fairness to all users, we are unable to provide additional free credits to individual users. For details on how credits are consumed, check our credits explained page below Plans in Neuro.

To provide a better trial experience, we currently offer a basic version for free. For basic users, we provide 200 credits to every new user upon registration, and 0 daily credits will be refreshed for free every day (soon will be more).

You can find more details on the subscription page.
