### **Our Commitment to Fair and Transparent Global Pricing**

To serve our global community effectively, Neuro has established a clear and consistent pricing structure. We understand that navigating international payments can sometimes be complex, and we are committed to making the process as transparent as possible. All our subscription and credit prices are standardized in United States Dollars (USD) to ensure fairness and equality for all users, regardless of their location.

This guide explains why we use USD as our pricing unit, how you can pay in your local currency, and what to expect regarding exchange rates and potential fees.

### **How Paying in Your Local Currency Works**

While our prices are listed in USD, you can absolutely pay using your local currency. The conversion process is handled automatically by your financial institution at the point of sale. Here is a clear breakdown of who handles what in the transaction process:

| Entity                                                                  | Role and Responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Neuro**                                                               | Sets the base price of the product in USD. For example, a subscription plan might be listed as \$9,9 USD. This is the amount that Neuro charges.                                                                                                                         |
| **Your Bank or Payment Provider**<br />(e.g., Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) | 1. Converts the USD price to your local currency.  2. Determines the exchange rate used for this conversion.  3. Applies any relevant fees, such as currency conversion or foreign transaction fees.  4. Charges you the final, converted amount in your local currency. |
|                                                                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**_\*In short: Neuro sets the USD price, and your bank determines the final amount you pay in your local currency._**

### **Understanding Potential Additional Charges**

The final amount you are charged may be slightly different from a direct conversion of the USD price you see online. This is due to fees charged by your bank, not by Neuro.

- Currency Conversion Fees: Many banks charge a small percentage fee for converting one currency to another. This is a standard practice for international transactions.
- Foreign Transaction Fees: Some card issuers add a surcharge for any purchase that is processed by a merchant in another country.

To avoid surprises, we strongly recommend that you contact your bank or card provider before making a purchase to ask about their specific policies and fees for international transactions in USD.
