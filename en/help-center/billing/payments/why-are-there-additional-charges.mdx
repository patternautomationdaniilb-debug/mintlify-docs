## **Our Commitment to Transparent Pricing**

At Manus, we are committed to transparent and straightforward pricing. The subscription prices displayed on our website are the base rates for our services and currently, the membership prices for Manus on both mobile and web platforms are consistent.

However, you may notice that the final amount charged is slightly higher than the advertised price. If you're experiencing higher prices on the mobile platform, it may be due to local taxes in your region. You can check your payment details to confirm if there are any tax-related price differences. This is typically due to taxes or fees required by your local government or financial institution, which are outside of Manus's control.

This article explains the most common reasons for additional charges to help you understand your invoice.
