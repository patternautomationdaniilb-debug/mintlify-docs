For Apple/Google payments, you need to make changes directly in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.

If you cannot see the "Edit billing" button, please contact us.

You can change your payment method on the manage subscription page.

As shown in the image, enter the subscription management page. Once there, you can add your new payment method. After adding it, you can delete your old payment method, thus completing the change of payment method.

First step, click your "Account".

Second step, click "Manage".

Third step, click "Edit billing".
