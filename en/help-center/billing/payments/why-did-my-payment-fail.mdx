To ensure your account security and rights, we strictly prohibit the use of third-party payment platforms for transactions. Such behavior may lead to the following risks:

1. **Payment Failure**: Third-party platform payments may fail to complete transactions, affecting your normal usage.
2. **Account Risk Control**: Due to third-party payment behavior automatically triggering system risk control mechanisms, your account may be restricted.
3. **Rights Impairment**: Payment failures or account restrictions may directly impact your user experience and rights.

Please make sure to complete payments through official channels to ensure safe and smooth transactions.

# **Your Bank Declined the Payment**

Your payment may have been blocked by your bank. Here’s what to check:

- Verify that your **card number**, **expiration date**, **CVC**, and **billing address** (including zip/postal code) are correct.
- Ensure your card has **sufficient funds**.
- Some banks block certain online or international transactions by default, if everything looks correct, please contact your bank or card provider.

_Note: We typically don’t receive detailed decline reasons from banks, so reaching out to them directly is often the quickest way to resolve payment issues._

# **Troubleshooting Tips**

Here’s a quick checklist to resolve most payment issues:

1. Double-check your **card details** and **billing address**.
2. **Clear your browser’s cache and cookies**, then retry the transaction.
3. Contact your **bank** to ensure there are no holds or blocks on your account.
4. If possible, try using a **different payment method**.
