## **Understanding and Resolving Overdue Payments**

An overdue payment can occur for several reasons, such as an expired credit card, insufficient funds, or a bank declining the charge. When this happens, your Manus subscription may be temporarily suspended, preventing you from making new payments or accessing premium features. This guide will walk you through the steps to resolve the issue based on where you originally subscribed.

## **How to Resolve Your Overdue Payment**

The steps to resolve an overdue payment depend on whether you subscribed directly through the Manus website or through a mobile app store (Apple App Store or Google Play Store).
