### **Can I change my invoice content?**

Currently, Neuro does not support modifying invoices that have already been generated.

### **Can I change my invoice date?**

At this time, Neuro does **not support changes to invoice dates**. All billing cycles and invoice generation schedules are fixed based on your subscription type.

### **Neuro Subscriptions/Plans**

Billing occurs on a **monthly or yearly basis** from the date you subscribed.

For example, if you subscribed on the 12th of the month, you will be billed again on the 12th of each following month or year.

Invoice dates align with this recurring schedule and cannot be modified.
