When using Manus, credit management is essential. Below are key strategies to help you optimize your credit usage effectively.

# **Strategies to Optimize Credit Usage**

## **1. Combine Similar Questions**

Whenever possible, group related or similar questions into one task. By doing so:

- You can reduce the number of separate attempts that consume credits.
- Streamlined grouping allows for consolidated and efficient resolution.

Example: Instead of asking separate questions about formatting and saving a file, combine them into one comprehensive query.

## **2. Streamline Instructions**

Provide clear, concise, and direct instructions when engaging Manus. Strategies include:

- Clearly stating your expectations or outcomes in one step instead of multiple vague instructions.
- Avoiding unnecessary elaboration or duplicate phrasing.

Example: Instead of asking, "Can you help create a report? I need a list, and can it also include charts?” streamline with, "Create a report with both a list and charts."

## **3. Reduce Repeated Attempts**

Repeatedly asking variations of the same question can exhaust credits unnecessarily. Instead:

- Review the responses provided carefully before resubmitting similar queries.
- Make corrections to your inputs or instructions for better success rates.

Example: If a question does not yield the intended answer, refine it based on the initial response instead of rephrasing aimlessly.

# **Benefits of Optimized Credit Usage**

By implementing these strategies, users can:

- Maximize efficiency with their current credit allocation.
- Experience smoother workflows and faster task completion.

Adhering to these practices ensures you get the most from Manus. Proactively planning your questions and refining how you interact with the platform can significantly improve your credit usage experience.
