### **Understanding the Daily Credit Refresh Process **

We understand it can be concerning when you log in expecting your 0 daily refresh credits (soon more) and don't see them. These credits reward you for being an active member of the Neuro community, and we want to ensure you receive them reliably.

Regarding daily credits, you need to log in to Neuro every day to claim 0 free credits. Please note that credit refresh may experience slight delays. The 0 daily credits are only valid for that day and will reset the next day; they will not accumulate in your account balance.

\***_Please note that Free users have a daily refreshed free credit usage limit of 0 credits per month. After reaching 0 credits, daily free credits will no longer refresh._**

Usually, when daily credits appear to be missing, it is due to one of a few common reasons related to timing, usage limits for free accounts, or how credits are displayed. This guide provides a step-by-step process to help you troubleshoot the issue and understand what to do if the problem persists.

### **Why Credits May Seem to Be Missing**

Since daily credits have a higher priority in the consumption order of different credit types, it's possible that your daily credits were consumed during the process of executing a task. Please note that, as a refresh-based credit type, the increase and decrease details of daily credits will not be displayed on the 'Details' homepage of the 'Usage' interface.

If you are certain that the daily credits have not been credited to your account, you can take a screenshot of your credit details interface after the credit refresh time on a certain day, before initiating any conversation, and send it to us.

Please make sure to include the real-time system clock, and we will investigate the issue for you.
