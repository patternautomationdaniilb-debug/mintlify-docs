**Our Commitment to Transparent Credit Usage**

Understanding how your credits are used is essential for maximizing the value of your Neuro subscription. We believe in complete transparency, which is why we provide a detailed and easy-to-understand credit usage page. This dashboard allows you to track every credit transaction, from purchases and monthly renewals to individual task consumption, giving you full control over your account.

This guide will walk you through how to access your usage history, what the information means, and what to do if you have any questions about a specific transaction.
