### **The Purpose of Daily Refresh Credits**

At Neuro, we want to reward our active users with consistent opportunities to create and innovate. Our daily refresh credits are a key part of this commitment. Every day, we provide you with a fresh batch of credits, giving you a risk-free way to experiment with new ideas, refine your projects, and explore the full potential of our platform without impacting your purchased credit balance.

This guide explains how these daily credits work, including how to claim them and what to expect from the daily reset.

### **How Daily Refresh Credits Work: A Detailed Breakdown**

Here is a clear summary of the rules governing your daily refresh credits:

| Feature       | Policy                   | Details                                                                                                                                                               |

| Credit Amount | 0 Credits Per Day        | Every user with an active Neuro account is eligible to receive 0 credits daily. (soon more)                                                                           |
| How to Claim  | Log In to Your Account   | Your daily credits are automatically granted when you log in to your Neuro account. No other action is required.                                                      |
| Reset Time    | Daily at 00:00 UTC       | The daily credit balance resets to 0 at midnight Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Unused credits from the previous 24-hour period are removed.                       |
| Accumulation  | Credits Do Not Roll Over | Daily refresh credits will not be added to your main credit balance. If you have 100 daily credits left at the end of the day, they will disappear at the reset time. |
| Validity      | Valid for 24 Hours       | The credits are only valid for the 24-hour period in which they are granted.                                                                                          |
