# **How do credits work?**

Credits are primarily consumed based on:

- **LLM tokens**: Used for task planning, decision making, and output generation.
- **Virtual machines**: Used for cloud environments that support file operations, browser automation, and code execution.
- **Third-party APIs**: Used for accessing integrated external services, such as financial data and professional databases.

The specific credits consumption for a task is determined by its complexity and duration. Credits are only consumed during active task processing. Completed tasks and the storage or deployment of their outputs do not consume any credits, so there's no need to delete completed tasks.

We provide a full refund of consumed credits for tasks that fail due to technical issues on our end. We will continuously optimize system efficiency and reduce the number of credits consumed per task.

# **How to get more credits?**

- For Free users, you can upgrade to a Pro membership for more credits.
- Members who need additional credits can switch to a higher plan.

# **Will credits expire?**

- Credits are consumed in the following order: event credits \> daily credits \> monthly credits \> add-on credits \> free credits.
- The monthly consumption limit for daily refresh credits for free users is set to 1,500 credits; paid users have no limit. Daily credits can only be used for Manus 1.6 lite.
- Monthly credits are obtained through subscription and automatically refresh on the same date each month based on your subscription date.
- Free credits never expire.
- Unused credits require an active paid subscription to remain valid. If your subscription is canceled, any remaining purchased credits may no longer be accessible.
- Event credits can be earned by participating in events and expire when the event ends.
- Monthly credits need to be used within the subscription period. For example, if you purchase a \$20 Pro membership on January 1st, you will receive 4000 monthly credits, and these credits need to be used before February 1st. If not used up, they will reset on February 1st.
