Understanding what happens to your credits after you cancel or let your Neuro subscription expire is essential to make the most of your membership benefits. Here’s a detailed guide:

### **Impact of Subscription Cancellation on Credits **

When your Neuro subscription is canceled or expires, the following occurs:

- All membership benefits, including access to credits, are terminated as soon as the subscription ends.
- Any unused credits remaining from monthly allocations are reset to 0 once the subscription cycle ends.
- For users with a seven-day free trial, if you cancel your subscription before the charge, there will be no charge incurred. If you cancel your subscription after being charged, there will be no refund, and only the next renewal will be cancelled.

### **Use of Monthly and Event Credits**

- **Monthly Credits**: These are tied directly to your active subscription. Once your subscription expires, any leftover monthly credits will no longer be available.
- **Add-On & Event Credits**: These credits can only be used with an active paid subscription. If your account switches to a Free membership or the subscription lapses, these credits become inactive.

  **_\*To avoid future confusion, we strongly encourage users to take note of whether they have upgraded their Pro plan, or that they have purchased add-on credits at the beginning._**

### **Reactivating Credits After Subscription Renewal**

If you renew your subscription or subscribe to a new membership plan, previously unused credits can be reactivated. However, monthly credits that were reset to 0 cannot be reinstated.

### **Recommendations for Credit Usage**

To avoid losing any credits, it’s highly recommended to:

- Utilize all purchased credits within your subscription cycle.
- Plan credit usage in advance, especially if you anticipate canceling your subscription or switching to a Free membership (Basic Plan).

By understanding and following these guidelines, you can make effective use of your credits and prevent their deactivation.
