For users with a seven-day free trial, if you cancel your subscription before being charged, you will not be charged after the trial expires; if you have already been charged, canceling your subscription after being charged will only cancel the next renewal, meaning you will not be charged for the next renewal, but the fees charged this time will not be refunded.

After purchasing our subscription, we will charge you monthly or annually based on the subscription plan. Once you cancel the subscription, you will no longer be charged for renewals.
