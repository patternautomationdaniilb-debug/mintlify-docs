### **Our Policy on Membership Transfers**

To ensure account security and maintain the integrity of user data, we **do not** support the direct transfer of membership status from one Neuro account to another.

However, if you wish to have your membership benefits on a different account, we have a straightforward workaround.

### **Recommended Steps to Change Your Membership Account**

If you have access to your original account, please follow these steps:

1. Cancel Your Active Subscription: First, log in to your current account and cancel your active subscription. This will prevent any future renewal charges on this account. You will be able to continue using your membership benefits until the end of the current billing cycle.
2. Purchase a New Subscription: Once your previous subscription is set to expire, log in to your new or desired account and purchase a new membership plan that suits your needs.

- _Please note that If you can no longer access the original account, please contact us and provide your billing information, and we will assist you in canceling the subscription._
