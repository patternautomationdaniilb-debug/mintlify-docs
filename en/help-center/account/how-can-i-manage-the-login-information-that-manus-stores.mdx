When users access certain websites or platforms for the first time using Neuro, they may encounter issues such as CAPTCHA verification. Users can resolve these issues by taking over Neuro's computer and manually logging in through Neuro's browser. Users can get more information on this page. Neuro will ask users to confirm whether to save the login status for this website, so that Neuro can access the website independently in the future without requiring manual assistance.

Besides, users can choose to completely disable this feature in Settings \> Cloud Browser, and individually manage the login information for specific websites previously saved in Neuro.
