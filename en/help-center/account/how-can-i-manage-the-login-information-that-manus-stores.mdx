When users access certain websites or platforms for the first time using Manus, they may encounter issues such as CAPTCHA verification. Users can resolve these issues by taking over Manus's computer and manually logging in through Manus's browser. Users can get more information on this [<u>page</u>](https://manus.im/help/cloud-browser)_._ Manus will ask users to confirm whether to save the login status for this website, so that Manus can access the website independently in the future without requiring manual assistance.

Besides, users can choose to completely disable this feature in Settings \> Cloud Browser, and individually manage the login information for specific websites previously saved in Manus.
