## **Our Commitment to Account Security**

Your email address is the primary identifier for your Manus account, linking it to your subscription, credit balance, and all the valuable assets you have created. To ensure the highest level of security and prevent unauthorized account changes, we have a strict policy regarding email modifications. We understand that you may need to update your email address, and this guide is here to explain our current policy and provide a clear path forward.

## **Our Current Policy on Email Changes**

**Directly changing the email address associated with an existing Manus account is not currently supported.** This policy is in place to protect the integrity of your account and data. Because your email serves as the unique key for all your activities and purchases, modifying it is a highly sensitive operation that we do not permit at this time.

However, we recognize that you may wish to use a different email address. The recommended solution is to create a new Manus account.

## **The Workaround: Creating a New Account**

If you need to switch to a new email, you will need to create a new account. It is crucial to understand that this new account will be completely separate from your old one. Subscriptions, credits, and generated assets will not transfer automatically.

Here is a step-by-step guide to ensure a smooth transition:

| Step                                | Action                                                                                                                                                                | Important Considerations                                                                                                                  |

| **1. Secure Your Assets**           | Before making any changes, log in to your old account and download all of your important generated assets (websites, images, documents, etc.) to your local computer. | Your assets are tied to your old account and will not be accessible from your new one. This is the most critical step to avoid data loss. |
| **2. Manage Your Subscription**     | On your old account, navigate to Settings \> Billing and cancel your active subscription. This will prevent any future renewal charges on the old account.            | You can continue to use the premium features on your old account until the end of the current billing period.                             |
| **3. Create Your New Account**      | Log out of your old account and register a new Manus account using your desired new email address.                                                                    | This will be a fresh account with no history, credits, or subscription.                                                                   |
| **4. Subscribe on the New Account** | Once you are ready, you can purchase a new subscription plan on your new account to access premium features.                                                          | You can now begin creating new assets and building your history on this new account.                                                      |
