## **Understanding Your Manus Account and Login Method**

It can be confusing when you log in to your account and discover that the Usage tab, where you track your credit balance and transaction history, is missing. This is a common issue that almost always has a simple solution: you have likely logged in using a different method than the one you used to create your account.

At Manus, each account is permanently and uniquely linked to a single login method. This guide will help you understand why this happens, how to identify your correct login method, and how to regain access to your account with all its features, including the Usage tab.

## **The Root Cause: Mutually Exclusive Login Methods**

Manus offers four distinct login methods for your convenience and security. It is critical to understand that these methods create separate, non-interchangeable accounts.

| Login Method            | How It Works                                                                                     |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Continue with Google    | Creates an account linked exclusively to your Google identity.                                   |
| Continue with Microsoft | Creates an account linked exclusively to your Microsoft identity.                                |
| Continue with Apple     | Creates an account linked exclusively to your Apple ID.                                          |
| Email and Password      | Creates a traditional account accessible only with that specific email and password combination. |

When you log in using a method you didn't originally register with, our system sees you as a new user and automatically creates a brand-new, empty account associated with that method. This new account has no subscription, no credit history, and therefore, no Usage tab.

\_Key Takeaway: If you registered with Google but later log in using your email and a password, you are not accessing your original account. You are creating a second, empty one. \_**_Please use the login method you originally registered with to log in to Manus. Thank you for your understanding and support._**
