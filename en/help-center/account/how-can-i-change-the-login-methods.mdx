### **Our Commitment to Flexible and Secure Access**

At Neuro, we aim to provide a login experience that is both convenient and secure. We offer several ways to access your account, allowing you to choose the method that works best for you. Your login method is the primary key to your account, safeguarding your subscription, credits, and all the work you create.

This guide explains the login methods we support, our current policy on changing them, and what you can do if you wish to use a different method than the one you originally chose.

### **Supported Login Methods**

When you create a Neuro account, you can choose from one of the following methods. It is important to note that your account is permanently linked to the method you select at registration.

### **Our Current Policy on Changing Login Methods**

Once an account is created, **its login method cannot be changed or switched to another type.** For example, an account registered using "Continue with Google" cannot be converted into an email-and-password account, nor can it be linked to a Microsoft or Apple ID.

This policy is in place for critical security reasons. Your chosen login method acts as the fundamental and unique identifier for your account. Treating it as a permanent fixture prevents unauthorized account takeovers and ensures a stable link between your identity and your data.
