### **Our Commitment to Platform Security and User Protection**

Receiving a notification that your account has been suspended can be a stressful experience, and we are here to help you understand why this happens and what you can do about it.

At Neuro, we use an automated security system to protect our users and our platform from potentially harmful or fraudulent activity. An account suspension is a protective measure that is triggered when our system detects behavior that deviates significantly from normal usage patterns.

This guide explains the most common reasons for suspension, how to appeal the decision, and what information you will need to provide to our team for a swift review.

### **Why Was My Account Suspended?**

Your account was likely suspended because our automated system flagged it for activity that could indicate a security risk. This is not a final decision, and we understand that these systems can sometimes make mistakes. The suspension is a temporary measure that allows us to pause activity while we verify that your account is secure.

### **How to Appeal a Suspension**

If you believe your account was suspended in error, we encourage you to file an appeal. Our team will personally review your case and work to restore your access as quickly as possible.

Please contact our support team and provide the necessary information outlined below.
