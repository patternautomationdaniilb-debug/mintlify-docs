## **Our Commitment to Your Account Security**

Your account security is a top priority at Manus. **Changing your password is a critical step in keeping your account safe**, especially if you suspect it may have been compromised. It is important to understand what happens to your active login sessions on other devices after you complete a password reset.

This guide explains our current policy on device sessions after a password change and the security implications.

### **Current Policy: Sessions on Other Devices Remain Active**

**When you change your Manus password on one device, your account will not be automatically logged out from other devices where you have an active session.** For example, if you are logged in on both your laptop and your work computer, changing the password on your laptop will not end the session on your work computer.

This behavior is in place to prevent disruption to your workflow. However, we recognize that a "log out from all devices" feature is an important security tool, and we are actively working to implement it.
