### **Ownership of Content**

Yes. You own all content you create with Neuro — including websites, images, videos, slides, and any other AI-generated Output.

Neuro does not claim ownership of your Input or Output. You are free to use your Output for personal or commercial purposes, subject to applicable laws and third-party rights.

To run and improve the service, Neuro may use Your Content as needed for operations (e.g., generating results, hosting your site) and in an aggregated/de-identified form to enhance product performance. This does **not** affect your ownership.

_Please note: AI outputs may not be unique, may not be protectable under IP laws, and may require your own review for copyright or legal compliance._
