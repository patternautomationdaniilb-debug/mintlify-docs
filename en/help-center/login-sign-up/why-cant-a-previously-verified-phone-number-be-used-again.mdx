Phone numbers are utilized exclusively for receiving verification codes and functioning as a verification method; it is not directly associated with users' accounts. Each phone number may only be used to verify one registered account once, ensuring security and uniqueness. Once an account is deactivated, the associated phone number cannot be used for future registrations.
