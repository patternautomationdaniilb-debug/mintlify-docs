The mechanism in place involves saving the MD5 hash of each user's phone number. When you enter your phone number, we match it solely using the MD5 hash and do not retain the actual phone number. This approach allows us to verify whether a phone number has been previously used. We appreciate your trust in this matter and assure you of our commitment to your privacy.
