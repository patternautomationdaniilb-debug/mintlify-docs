## **Understanding Login Error 1043**

The 1043 error indicates that the email you are attempting to log in with has indeed successfully logged in to Manus before. However, **you have chosen an incorrect login method** this time. It does not mean your account has been compromised.

## **The Core Reason: Mutually Exclusive Login Methods**

Currently, Manus supports 4 login methods: Google/Apple/Microsoft account and Email-Password, which are mutually exclusive. Users can only access Manus **using the login method they selected when registering their account.**

```
{"code":1043,"message":"The mailbox has been registered","detail":{},"error_name":"user.exceptions.ExistSameEmailError","msg":"The mailbox has been registered","error":"user.exceptions.ExistSameEmailError"}
```

## **What If I Can't Remember My Original Login Method?**

If you are unsure which method you used, here are a few tips:

- **Check Your Email:** Search your primary email inboxes (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) for a "Welcome to Manus" email. The address that received this email is the one tied to your account.
- **Contact Support:** If you are still unable to log in, please contact our support team with your invoice from your Manus purchase, or the email address you received our official advertising emails with, so we can look it up.
