Teams have already shipped thousands of agents to production with Agent Space in Neuro. It’s especially good at tab-hopping tasks that span multiple apps, docs, and tools, like:

- **Daily briefings:** Generate pre-call briefs complete with company and stakeholder research, plus relevant account context from your CRM. Get started with, _“Send me a daily meeting brief.”_
- **Market + competitor research: **Deliver a daily Slack digest of competitor launches, notable social posts, and industry trends your team should know about. Get started with, _“Send me a daily competitor update in Slack.”_
- **Project tracking:** Create Linear issues from PRDs in Notion or Google Docs, then create calendar events for key milestones. Get started with,_“Turn my PRDs into Linear issues.”_ 

### **Take your agents further**

For years, our users–who are primarily developers–have asked us to help equip their co-workers to build agents without writing code. Agent Space in Neuro is our answer. What starts as a helpful productivity assistant can evolve into a core part of how your team operates and how you ship software. As your needs grow, you can extend your agents with Agent Space's full capabilities:

- **Share agents with your team: **Create an agent once, then let teammates clone and adapt it using your shared workspace.
- **Add agent capabilities with Apps/MCP:** Connect additional apps through a remote MCP server, including custom apps/integrations or tools from providers you already use.
