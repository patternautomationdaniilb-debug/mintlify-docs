   - Unambiguous about what you want
   - Easy to understand
   - No confusion possible

✅ SPECIFIC
   - Details matter
   - Describes output exactly
   - Includes constraints and preferences

✅ COMPLETE
   - All necessary context provided
   - Background information included
   - No missing information

```

### The Prompt Formula

```
CONTEXT + TASK + CONSTRAINTS + FORMAT = GREAT RESULTS

Context: Why this matters, background information
Task: What specifically do you want done
Constraints: Limitations, preferences, scope
Format: How should output be delivered
```

### Example

```
POOR PROMPT:
"Create a presentation"

GOOD PROMPT:
"Create a 10-slide presentation on sustainable fashion trends 
for 2025. Include: definition of sustainable fashion, 3 key 
trends with data, brand examples, environmental impact, and 
recommendations. Format as PowerPoint, use professional design, 
include 1-2 images per slide with citations."
```

---

## 2. Core Techniques

### Technique 1: Be Specific About Scope

**The Problem:** Vague scope leads to vague results.

**The Solution:** Define exactly what you want.

```
VAGUE:
"Analyze this data"

SPECIFIC:
"Analyze Q4 sales data from my attached Excel file. Focus on:
- Revenue trends by product category
- Customer acquisition cost by channel
- Regional performance variation
Generate charts for top 3 insights and recommend 3 
growth strategies for Q1"
```

### Technique 2: Provide Context

**The Problem:** Without context, Neuro might misunderstand your needs.

**The Solution:** Explain why this matters.

```
WITHOUT CONTEXT:
"Write a blog post about productivity"

WITH CONTEXT:
"Write a 1500-word blog post about productivity for my 
SaaS startup audience (developers, 25-40, technical). 
They struggle with context-switching and focus. Include 
practical tools, scientific findings, and real examples. 
SEO-optimize for 'productivity' and 'focus' keywords."
```

### Technique 3: Specify Format

**The Problem:** Without format guidance, output might not fit your needs.

**The Solution:** Describe the exact output format.

```
WITHOUT FORMAT:
"Create a customer list"

WITH FORMAT:
"Create a customer list in Excel format with these columns:
- Name, Email, Company, Industry, Contact Date, 
  Purchase History, Engagement Score (1-5), Notes
Include 20-30 sample customers from tech industry. 
Format with header row, data validation for Industry, 
and conditional formatting for Engagement Score."
```

### Technique 4: Use Examples

**The Problem:** Neuro might guess what you want.

**The Solution:** Show examples of desired output.

```
WITHOUT EXAMPLES:
"Write customer testimonials"

WITH EXAMPLES:
"Write 5 customer testimonials for my SaaS product. 
Format like these examples:

Example 1:
'Before [Product], I spent 5 hours daily on [task]. 
Now I spend 30 minutes. The ROI is incredible.' 
- Jane Smith, VP Operations at TechCorp

Example 2:
'Game-changer for our team. Implementation took 2 days, 
and we saw results immediately.' 
- Michael Johnson, CEO at StartupXYZ

Write 5 similar testimonials, mixing industries and use cases."
```

### Technique 5: Break Down Complex Tasks

**The Problem:** Too much at once can produce mediocre results.

**The Solution:** Break into steps, ask for iterative improvement.

```
COMPLEX (ALL AT ONCE):
"Create a complete marketing plan for my product launch"

BROKEN DOWN:
Step 1: "Research my target market demographics. Who are they?"
Step 2: "Based on that, identify the 3 best marketing channels"
Step 3: "Create a 2-week pre-launch campaign strategy"
Step 4: "Develop launch day tactics"
Step 5: "Plan post-launch 30-day follow-up"

Then combine all into comprehensive plan.
```

### Technique 6: Set Quality Standards

**The Problem:** Without quality guidance, output might be generic.

**The Solution:** Specify quality requirements.

```
WITHOUT QUALITY:
"Write a product description"

WITH QUALITY:
"Write a product description that:
- Leads with the key benefit (not features)
- Uses active voice
- Includes 2-3 specific examples
- Mentions the problem solved
- Shows ROI/impact
- Uses conversational tone (not corporate)
- Is 150-200 words
- Makes reader want to learn more
- Includes a clear call-to-action"
```

**Solutions:**

1. Ask follow-up questions
2. Ask for more depth on specific parts
3. Request additional analysis
4. Ask "why" questions

```
FOLLOW-UP:
"That analysis is helpful. Can you dig deeper into:
1. The customer acquisition cost by channel - 
   what's driving the $150 difference between 
   PPC and organic?
2. The churn pattern - which customer segment 
   is churning most? Why?
3. For the growth strategy - what's the specific 
   implementation timeline and resource requirements?"
```

### Problem: Format or Structure Issues

**Symptoms:**

- Output is in wrong format
- Structure doesn't match what you wanted
- Hard to use the results

**Solutions:**

1. Specify format in first request
2. Ask for reformatting
3. Request in different structure
4. Ask for export in specific format

```
REFORMATTING REQUEST:
"Can you reorganize that analysis into:

## 8. Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Technique 1: Chain of Thought

Ask Neuro to think through problems step-by-step:

```
"Walk me through how to solve this step-by-step:

The problem: We have a 40% churn rate in Year 2.

For this problem:
1. What are the likely root causes? (Think through each)
2. For each cause, what's the evidence we'd see? 
3. How would we diagnose which is actually happening?
4. For the most likely cause, what's the intervention?
5. How would we measure success?

Be thorough in your thinking process. Don't jump 
to conclusions."
```

### Technique 2: Comparative Thinking

Ask for comparisons to clarify thinking:

```
"Compare our product to [Competitor A] and 
[Competitor B] on these dimensions:
- Core problem solved
- Target market fit
- Pricing model and rationale
- Feature differentiation
- Go-to-market approach
- Key strengths and weaknesses

For each comparison, explain the strategic implications 
for our positioning."
```

### Technique 3: Devil's Advocate

Ask Neuro to challenge assumptions:

```
"Our strategy is to focus exclusively on Enterprise 
customers. I want you to argue against this.

Give me:
1. The 5 strongest arguments against this strategy
2. Market evidence supporting each argument
3. What could go wrong with this approach?
4. What opportunities might we be missing?
5. What would change your mind about this strategy?

Be thorough and compelling in your counter-arguments."
```

### Technique 4: Meta-Analysis

Ask Neuro to analyze its own analysis:

```
"You gave me 5 growth recommendations. Now I want 
you to analyze those recommendations:

1. Which have the strongest evidence behind them?
2. Which are most likely to succeed (probability)?
3. Which have the highest ROI potential?
4. Which are most risky?
5. If you could only implement 2, which would you 
   prioritize and why?
6. What could prevent each from working?

Be critical of your own recommendations."
```

### Technique 5: Constraint-Based Thinking

Give tight constraints to force creative thinking:

```
"We want to increase revenue 30% but can't:
- Raise prices
- Add features (locked into current roadmap)
- Hire more people
- Increase marketing budget
- Change our business model

Given these constraints, what are 5 creative ways 
we could grow 30%?

For each, explain:
- Why it could work
- What needs to happen
- Timeline
- Resources required
- Probability of success"
```

## 10. Final Tips

### Master Prompt Structure

```
Best structure:

1. CONTEXT (2-3 sentences)
   Why does this matter? What's the background?

2. TASK (1-2 sentences)
   What specifically do you want done?

3. DETAILS (3-5 bullet points)
   What are the specifics, constraints, requirements?

4. FORMAT (2-3 sentences)
   How should output be structured/formatted?

5. QUALITY (2-3 bullet points)
   What quality standards should be met?
```

### Be Specific

```
VAGUE: "Analyze our data"
SPECIFIC: "Analyze our Q4 sales data focusing on 
revenue trends by product category and region. 
Create a comparison to Q3 and recommend top 3 
growth opportunities."
```

### Provide Examples

```
"Here's an example of what I want:
[Show example structure/style/format]

Now create something similar for [your context]"
```

### Iterate & Refine

Rarely is the first output perfect. Ask follow-ups:

```
"That's helpful. Now can you:
1. Expand on point #3
2. Add specific examples
3. Reorganize with [topic] first
4. Include ROI for each recommendation"
```

### Use Formatting

Make prompts easy to read:

```
CLEAR:
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use headers for sections
- Use bold for emphasis
- Keep paragraphs short

Hard to read:
"I need you to analyze the data by looking at trends 
and metrics and create visualizations and make 
recommendations about strategy and what we should 
do to grow our business in different ways"

Easy to read:
"Analyze the data:
- Revenue trends by product and region
- Key metrics and performance indicators
- Create 5+ visualizations

Recommendations:
- Top 3 growth opportunities
- Implementation timeline
- Expected ROI"
```
