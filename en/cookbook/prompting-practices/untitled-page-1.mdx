title: "Main Prompting Rule"
---

## **The Golden Rule**

**The better your prompt, the better your results.**

Neuro AI is powerful, but it needs clear instructions. A well-structured prompt dramatically improves output quality, relevance, and usefulness.

---

## Part 1: Fundamental Prompting Principles

### Rule 1: Always Use the Three-Part Structure

Every effective prompt has three essential components:

```
[ROLE/CONTEXT] + [TASK] + [FORMAT] = Excellent Results
```

**ROLE/CONTEXT** — Who is the AI and what's the situation? **TASK** — What specifically needs to be done? **FORMAT** — How should the result be delivered?

#### Example: Poor vs Good

**❌ POOR:**

```
"Analyze this spreadsheet"
```

**✅ GOOD:**

```
"You are a financial analyst specializing in quarterly 
reporting. Analyze the Q4 2024 sales spreadsheet attached. 
Focus on: revenue trends by product line, variance analysis 
vs Q3, and key growth drivers. 

Present results as:
- 1-page executive summary
- Detailed findings with charts
- Top 3 recommendations with expected impact"
```

---

### Rule 2: Be Specific, Not Vague

**The Specificity Principle:** The more specific your instruction, the more precise the result.

#### Vagueness Destroys Quality

```
❌ VAGUE:
"Write about productivity"

✅ SPECIFIC:
"Write a 1500-word technical blog post about productivity 
for software engineers. Audience: developers aged 25-40 with 
5+ years experience. Focus on: deep work, context-switching 
costs, and focus techniques. Include: 3 research studies, 
2-3 code examples, and 1 case study. Tone: expert but 
accessible. Include SEO keywords: 'deep work', 'focus', 
'developer productivity'. Format with H2 headers, 
introduction, sections, and clear conclusion."
```

#### Vagueness Examples to Avoid

```
❌ "Check this"
✅ "Review this document for: grammar errors, logical 
   consistency, factual accuracy, and formatting issues. 
   List each error with location and suggested fix."

❌ "Find problems"
✅ "Identify and rank 5-10 critical issues that could impact 
   business operations. For each: describe the problem, 
   estimate impact (high/medium/low), and recommend solution."

❌ "Create a plan"
✅ "Create a 90-day marketing plan including: audience analysis, 
   4-5 channels with monthly budget allocation, weekly 
   tactics, success metrics, and contingency plans."
```

---

### Rule 3: Assign a Clear Role

**The Role Principle:** Neuro AI performs better when it knows exactly what role to play.

A clear role provides:

- Expertise context
- Professional standards
- Relevant knowledge framework
- Appropriate tone and approach

#### Role Assignment Structure

```
You are [ROLE] with [EXPERIENCE] and [EXPERTISE].
Your task is to [SPECIFIC FUNCTION].
Consider [RELEVANT CONTEXT].
```

#### Strong Role Examples

**For Document Analysis:**

```
"You are a senior auditor with 15 years of experience 
in financial statement audits under IFRS and local 
accounting standards. You specialize in identifying 
material misstatements and assessing audit risk."
```

**For Strategic Planning:**

```
"You are a management consultant specializing in 
growth strategy for B2B SaaS companies. You have 
experience scaling startups from $1M to $100M ARR."
```

**For Legal Review:**

```
"You are a regulatory compliance expert with deep 
knowledge of data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, 
local laws). You assess legal and compliance risks."
```

**For Technical Analysis:**

```
"You are a senior software architect with 12 years 
of experience designing scalable systems. You 
specialize in performance optimization and AWS 
infrastructure."
```

---

### Rule 4: Separate Data from Instructions

**The Separation Principle:** Keep data and instructions distinct for clarity.

#### Recommended Structure

```
[ROLE AND CONTEXT]

DATA:
[Insert documents, tables, numbers, or information here]

TASK:
[What needs to be done with the data]

OUTPUT FORMAT:
[How the result should be presented]

CONSTRAINTS:
[Any limitations or requirements]
```

#### Structured Example

```
You are a financial analyst reviewing quarterly results.

DATA:
Q4 2024 Financial Summary:
- Revenue: $5.2M (vs $4.8M in Q3)
- Operating expenses: $2.1M
- Net income: $1.8M
- Customer count: 2,450 (vs 2,200 in Q3)

TASK:
1. Calculate key metrics (growth rates, margins, CAC trends)
2. Identify top 3 positive trends
3. Highlight 2-3 concerns
4. Recommend 3 specific actions

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
- Metrics Dashboard (table)
- Key Findings (bullets, 3 per section)
- Recommendations (prioritized by impact)
- Appendix (supporting calculations)

CONSTRAINTS:
- Use only provided data
- Reference specific numbers in all analysis
- Keep recommendations implementable in 30 days
```

---

### Rule 5: Show Examples of Desired Output

**The Example Principle:** Showing is more effective than telling.

When you provide examples of the desired format, Neuro AI is more likely to match that style and structure.

#### Few-Shot Prompting Structure

```
You are [ROLE].

Here are examples of the correct format:

EXAMPLE 1:
INPUT: [Sample input data]
OUTPUT: [Desired output format and style]

EXAMPLE 2:
INPUT: [Different sample data]
OUTPUT: [Matching format and style]

Now apply this approach to:
INPUT: [Your actual data]
```

#### Practical Example: Recommendation Format

```
You are a business strategist analyzing growth opportunities.

When presenting recommendations, format them like this:

EXAMPLE 1:
RECOMMENDATION: Expand sales team by 2 people
RATIONALE: Current team is at capacity; each rep manages 
12 accounts, while industry standard is 8-10
EXPECTED IMPACT: +30% new customer acquisition
INVESTMENT: $250K annually
TIMELINE: Hire by end of Q1
RISK: Onboarding time may delay impact to Q2

EXAMPLE 2:
RECOMMENDATION: Improve product onboarding
RATIONALE: Customer churn in first 30 days is 18%, 
above 12% benchmark
EXPECTED IMPACT: 6% improvement in retention (=$180K ARR)
INVESTMENT: $80K engineering time
TIMELINE: 8 weeks
RISK: May distract from feature roadmap

Now provide 3 similar recommendations for:
[Your business situation]
```

---

### Rule 6: Use Step-by-Step Reasoning (Chain of Thought)

**The Reasoning Principle:** Asking Neuro AI to show its work produces better results.

Request explicit steps to ensure logical analysis and catch errors.

#### How to Apply

Add explicit instruction: **"Solve this step-by-step. Show all intermediate reasoning and calculations."**

#### Example for Analytical Tasks

```
You are a compliance auditor checking financial controls.

TASK: Assess whether the company's bad debt reserve is adequate.

DATA:
Accounts receivable aging:
- 0-30 days: $2,000K (customers: solid credit)
- 31-60 days: $800K (customers: mixed credit)
- 61-90 days: $400K (customers: weak credit, payment delays)
- 90+ days: $600K (customers: bankruptcy risk)

INSTRUCTIONS - WORK STEP BY STEP:
1. For each aging bucket, estimate probability of collection
2. Calculate required reserve for each bucket
3. Calculate total required reserve
4. Compare to company's existing reserve
5. State whether reserve is adequate, excessive, or deficient
6. Show all intermediate calculations
7. Explain your assumptions for each bucket

FORMAT:
- Aging Bucket Analysis (table with probabilities)
- Reserve Calculation (step-by-step math)
- Assessment (adequate/deficient by $X)
- Recommendations
```

---

### Rule 7: Specify Expected Output Format

**The Format Principle:** Clear output specifications prevent wasted revision rounds.

Neuro AI works best when you specify exactly how you want results formatted.

#### Format Specifications to Include

```
✅ Output medium: (Excel, Word document, HTML, Markdown, etc.)
✅ Structure: (Executive summary + details, sections, tables)
✅ Length: (1 page, 5 pages, word count)
✅ Detail level: (High-level overview vs detailed analysis)
✅ Visual elements: (Charts, diagrams, tables)
✅ Language and tone: (Technical, business casual, formal)
✅ Specific sections: (What must be included)
```

#### Example Specification

```
OUTPUT FORMAT SPECIFICATIONS:

Medium: PDF-ready document
Structure:
  1. Executive Summary (1 page max)
  2. Key Findings (bullets, 5-7 items)
  3. Detailed Analysis (3-5 sections with subheadings)
  4. Recommendations (table with: # | Action | Impact | Timeline | Cost)
  5. Appendix (supporting data, calculations)

Length: 8-12 pages total
Visuals: 4-6 professional charts/tables
Tone: Professional but conversational
Font specs: Heading style shows importance hierarchy
Emphasis: Bold for key numbers, italics for concepts

Specific requirements:
- All claims backed by data citations
- ROI calculation for each recommendation
- Risk assessment for each major recommendation
```

---

### Rule 8: Set Quality Standards Explicitly

**The Quality Principle:** Define what "good" means for your specific task.

Without quality standards, Neuro AI might produce generic results that don't meet your needs.

#### Quality Standards to Specify

```
✅ Accuracy: How precise must answers be?
✅ Completeness: What aspects must be covered?
✅ Depth: Surface level or deep analysis?
✅ Actionability: How specific/implementable?
✅ Credibility: Must sources be cited?
✅ Originality: Can it be generic or must it be custom?
```

#### Example Quality Standards

```
QUALITY STANDARDS FOR THIS ANALYSIS:

ACCURACY:
- All numbers must match source documents exactly
- No rounding differences > $1K
- Calculations must be verified

COMPLETENESS:
- Must address all 5 criteria mentioned
- No key aspect can be omitted
- Must include risk assessment for each finding

DEPTH:
- Analysis must go beyond surface observations
- Include root cause analysis, not just symptoms
- Explain the "why" behind each finding

ACTIONABILITY:
- Recommendations must be specific enough to implement
- Include step-by-step instructions
- Specify responsible party and timeline for each action

CREDIBILITY:
- All claims backed by data citations
- When using industry benchmarks, cite the source
- Distinguish between facts, analysis, and assumptions

ORIGINALITY:
- Tailor analysis to OUR business context
- Don't provide generic recommendations
- Address our specific constraints and opportunities
```

---

## Part 2: Advanced Prompting Techniques

### Rule 9: Protect Against Hallucinations

**The Accuracy Principle:** Neuro AI can sometimes generate false information. Protect yourself with explicit safeguards.

#### Technique 1: Require Citations

```
INSTRUCTION:
"When answering, you MUST cite specific sources. If information 
comes from the document, write: 'According to [document name], 
page X: [quote]'. If information is NOT in the documents, 
write 'This information is not provided in the documents.' 
NEVER make up information or use general knowledge beyond 
what's provided."
```

#### Technique 2: Limit Knowledge Domain

```
INSTRUCTION:
"Use ONLY the information provided in the attached documents. 
Do not use general knowledge about [topic]. If something isn't 
in the documents, say so explicitly. Do not infer, assume, or 
apply external knowledge."
```

#### Technique 3: Require Confidence Levels

```
INSTRUCTION:
"For each conclusion, specify your confidence level:

- CONFIDENT: Information is explicitly stated in documents
- INFERRED: Logical conclusion from information provided
- UNCERTAIN: Limited information, could be wrong
- UNAVAILABLE: No information provided

Example:
Finding: Revenue will grow 20% next quarter
Confidence: INFERRED (based on current growth rate and 
Q4 pipeline data)"
```

---

### Rule 10: Use Comparative Analysis

**The Clarity Principle:** Comparing options helps clarify thinking and identify best choices.

#### Comparative Analysis Structure

```
TASK: Compare [Option A], [Option B], and [Option C]

COMPARISON DIMENSIONS:
1. [Dimension 1] - Why it matters
2. [Dimension 2] - Why it matters
3. [Dimension 3] - Why it matters

For each comparison:
- Describe pros and cons
- Assign a score (1-5)
- Explain the score
- Note any caveats or context

SUMMARY:
- Overall winner and why
- When Option B might be preferred
- When Option C makes sense
- Key decision factors
```

---

### Rule 11: Request Devil's Advocate Analysis

**The Challenge Principle:** Ask Neuro AI to argue against the proposal to identify risks and weaknesses.

```
INSTRUCTION:
"I've proposed the following strategy: [Strategy description]

Now I want you to argue AGAINST this strategy. Provide:

1. The 5 strongest arguments against this approach
2. Real-world evidence that it might fail
3. What could go wrong
4. Hidden assumptions I'm making
5. What would need to change for you to recommend this

Be thorough and compelling in your counter-arguments."
```

---

### Rule 12: Apply Constraint-Based Thinking

**The Creativity Principle:** Tight constraints force innovative solutions.

```
TASK: We need to increase revenue 30%, but we CANNOT:
- Raise prices
- Add features (locked roadmap)
- Hire more people
- Increase marketing spend

CONSTRAINT: We only have $50K/month budget

Given these constraints, what are 5 creative ways we could grow?

For each:
- Why it could work
- What needs to happen
- Timeline and resources
- Probability of success
```

## Part 4: Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Mixing Data and Instructions

**❌ WRONG:**

```
"Analyze the Q4 sales report which shows revenue of $5.2M
and customer growth of 15% and please tell me if that's good
and what we should do about it and format it nicely."
```

**✅ RIGHT:**

```
DATA:
Q4 Results:
- Revenue: $5.2M (up from $4.8M in Q3)
- Customer count: up 15% YoY
- Margin: 35%

TASK:
1. Assess performance vs benchmarks
2. Identify top 3 trends
3. Recommend 3 actions

FORMAT:
Executive summary + detailed analysis + recommendations
```

---

### Mistake 2: Vague Success Criteria

**❌ WRONG:**

```
"Give me a report on our market."
```

**✅ RIGHT:**

```
"Create a market analysis report covering:
1. Market size and growth (with projections)
2. Top 10 competitors (with positioning)
3. Customer segments (demographics and needs)
4. Entry barriers and competitive advantages
5. Growth opportunities for our company

Include: market research sources, competitive positioning 
map, TAM/SAM/SOM analysis, and 3 strategic recommendations."
```

---

### Mistake 3: Assuming Neuro AI Knows Your Context

**❌ WRONG:**

```
"Update the pricing strategy based on recent changes."
```

**✅ RIGHT:**

```
"Our pricing strategy context:
- Current price: $99/month (vs $89 for Competitor A, $129 for Competitor B)
- Customer segment: Mid-market B2B SaaS
- Recent changes: 3 new competitors entered market, our churn up 2%
- Goal: Increase revenue 15% without increasing churn

Analyze whether we should:
1. Increase price to $129
2. Keep current pricing
3. Introduce tiered pricing

For each option: impact on revenue, churn, positioning, 
and recommended messaging."
```

---

### Mistake 4: Not Being Specific About Constraints

**❌ WRONG:**

```
"Create a marketing plan."
```

**✅ RIGHT:**

```
"Create a 90-day marketing plan with these constraints:
- Budget: $50K
- Team: 1 marketing manager + 1 contractor (10 hrs/week)
- Timeline: Must show results by end of Q1
- Goals: 25% increase in website traffic, 100 qualified leads
- Channels: Focus on LinkedIn, content, and partnerships
  (not paid ads or traditional marketing)
- Audience: B2B enterprise software buyers, $500M+ companies
- Current situation: 500 website visitors/month, no leads yet"
```
