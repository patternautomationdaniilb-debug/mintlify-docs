We take the security of your information seriously and have implemented a range of safeguards to protect it. As detailed in the **"Security"** section of our Privacy Policy, our approach includes:

- **Technical Safeguards**: We use modern security technologies to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.
- **Organizational Safeguards**: We have internal policies and procedures in place to ensure that your data is handled securely and that access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
- **Physical Safeguards**: We employ physical security measures to protect our facilities and equipment.

While we use commercially reasonable safeguards to protect your information, it's important to remember that no online service can be 100% secure. We encourage you to use the service at your own discretion and to take steps to protect your own information, such as using a strong password and enabling two-factor authentication where available.
