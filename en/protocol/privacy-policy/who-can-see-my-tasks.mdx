The visibility of your tasks depends on your account type: whether you are an individual user or part of a Team Plan.

**Individual Plan Accounts**

If you have an individual account, your tasks are **private by default.** No one else can see your tasks unless you explicitly choose to share them.

**Team Plan Accounts**

If you are a member of a Team Plan, the visibility of your tasks is determined by your role within the team, as outlined in our [<u>Privacy Policy</u>](https://manus.im/privacy).

| Role                   | Task Visibility                                                                                                                                             |
| :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Team Owner**         | Can access **all session data** of team members, including task steps and content. They can also monitor credit usage and export session data.              |
| **Team Administrator** | Can access **a subset of session data** and manage credit allocation. They cannot view personal account details or detailed individual session information. |
| **Team Member**        | Your tasks are visible to your Team Owner and, to a limited extent, your Team Administrator.                                                                |

For specific details about your team's policies, we recommend contacting your Team Owner or Administrator.
