No, the Neuro platform is not intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. This is clearly stated in the "Children" section of our Privacy Policy.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at<u>info@patternautomation.com</u>  so that we can take appropriate action.
