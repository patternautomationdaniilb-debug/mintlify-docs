**Understanding CreditsCredits serve as Neuro's universal currency for platform operations. Every action your AI agents perform—from analyzing data to generating code—consumes credits based on the task's complexity and the resources required.**

**Type of Credits**

**Monthly Subscription Credits - included with your paid plan and renewed automatically each month. These are expiring credits.**

**Top-Up Credits - Purchase additional credits when you need them. These are non-expiring and available to premium members.**

**Promotional & Event Grants - Bonus credits from special events, promotions, or referrals. These are non-expiring.**

**Refunds - Credits returned due to technical issues or failed tasks. These are non-expiring.**

**Note: Only premium members may purchase and use top-up credits.**

**How do credits work?**

Credits are primarily consumed based on:

- **LLM tokens**: Used for task planning, decision making, and output generation.
- **Virtual machines**: Used for cloud environments that support file operations, browser automation, and code execution.
- **Third-party APIs**: Used for accessing integrated external services, such as financial data and professional databases.

The specific credits consumption for a task is determined by its complexity and duration. Credits are only consumed during active task processing - completed tasks and the storage or deployment of their outputs do not consume any credits, so there's no need to delete completed tasks.

We do provide a full refund of consumed credits for tasks that fail due to technical issues on our end. We will continuously optimize system efficiency and reduce the number of credits consumed per task.

**Usage examples**

**Here are some examples demonstrating credits consumption across different task types and complexity levels, watch playbook on **[**patternautomation.com**](http://patternautomation.com)** .**

**Credit Priority:**

- **When you use Neuro, expiring credits are consumed first. Only after your expiring credits run out will non-expiring credits be used.**

**Will credits expire?**

- **Credits are consumed in the following order: event credits, daily credits, monthly credits, top-up credits, and free credits.**
- **Monthly credits are obtained through subscription and automatically refresh on the same date each month based on your subscription date.**
- **Free credits and top-up credits never expire.**
- **Event credits can be earned by participating in events and expire when the event ends.**
