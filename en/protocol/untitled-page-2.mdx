**3. Ordering and Fees**

**3.1 Third-Party Processors**

The Company uses Stripe as its third-party service provider for payment services (e.g., card acceptance, merchant settlement, and related services) (“**Payment Processor**”). If you make a purchase on the Services, you will be required to provide your payment details and any additional information required to complete your order directly to our Payment Processor. You agree to be bound by Stripe’s Privacy Policy (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and its Terms of Service (currently accessible at https://stripe.com/ssa) and hereby consent and authorize the Company and Payment Processor to share any information and payment instructions you provide with one or more Payment Processor(s) to the minimum extent required to complete your transactions. Please note that online payment transactions may be subject to validation checks by our Payment Processor and your card issuer, and we are not responsible if your card issuer declines to authorize payment for any reason. For your protection, our Payment Processor uses various fraud prevention protocols and industry standard verification systems to reduce fraud and you authorize it to verify and authenticate your payment information. Your card issuer may charge you an online handling fee or processing fee. We are not responsible for this. In some jurisdictions, our Payment Processor may use third parties under strict confidentiality and data protection requirements for the purposes of payment processing services.

**3.2 Payment and Order Processing**

You shall pay all fees or charges (“**Fees**”) to your account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a Fee is due and payable. By providing Company and/or our Payment Processor with your payment information, you agree that Company and/or our Payment Processor is authorized to immediately invoice your account for all Fees due and payable to Company hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required. You shall immediately notify Company of any change in your payment information to maintain its completeness and accuracy. Company reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods in its sole discretion. You agree to have sufficient funds or credit available upon placement of any order to ensure that the purchase price is collectible by us. Your failure to provide accurate payment information to Company and/or our Payment Processor or our inability to collect payment constitutes your material breach of this Agreement. Except as set forth in this Agreement, all Fees for the Services are non-refundable.

**3.2.1 Payment Methods:**

 

You may pay for the Services using the following methods:

 

•Online payment via credit card, debit card, or other electronic payment methods supported by our Payment Processor;

•Invoice payment (for enterprise or business customers, subject to the Company's approval and credit terms).

Electronic Invoices and Reports:

 

For all transactions, the Company will issue electronic invoices and service reports. These documents will be sent to the email address associated with your account and will also be available in your account dashboard. You agree to receive invoices and reports in electronic form.

Tariffs and Pricing:

 

Service costs are calculated based on tariffs published on each solution/service website at [[patternautomation.ai](http://patternautomation.ai)] or [[patternautomation.com](http://patternautomation.com)]. The prices can be mentioned on the second call with Sales Team from Pattern Automation after Discovery Call. The Company reserves the right to change tariffs and pricing at any time, with notice to users as required by applicable law. Changes to pricing will not affect subscriptions already paid for the current billing period.

 

Taxes:

All fees are exclusive of applicable taxes, duties, and governmental charges (collectively, "Taxes"). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with your purchase, except for taxes based on the Company's net income. If the Company is required to collect or pay Taxes, such amounts will be invoiced to you and you agree to pay such Taxes.

**3.3 Taxes**

The Fees do not include any Sales Tax (defined below) that may be due in connection with the Services provided under this Agreement. If Company determines it has a legal obligation to collect Sales Tax from you in connection with this Agreement, Company shall collect such Sales Tax in addition to the Fees. If any services, or payments for any services, under this Agreement are subject to any Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Company, you shall be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you shall indemnify Company for any liability or expense Company may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes. Upon Company’s request, you will provide it with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes. For purposes of this Section, “**Sales Tax**” means any sales or use tax and any other tax measured by sales proceeds that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.

**4. Subscription; Credit; and Refund Policy**

**4.1 Subscription Management**

Certain services or specific portions thereof are only available with a paid subscription. Depending on the type of subscription plan selected at the time of purchase, you will be billed periodically (monthly) in advance. At the end of each billing cycle, your subscription will automatically renew at the then-current pricing unless cancelled by either you or us. By subscribing, you authorize Company to charge the payment method designated in your account now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period.

You can cancel your subscription renewal by contacting us via email at [info@patternautomation.com](mailto:info@patternautomation.com) or through the user profile page. You will not receive a refund for fees already paid for the current subscription period, and you will continue to have access to the service until the end of your current subscription period.

**4.2 Billing and Fee Changes**

You must provide our payment system with accurate and complete billing information, including your full name, address, state, postal code, phone number, and valid payment method details. If automatic billing fails for any reason, the Company will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must manually make full payment corresponding to the billing period indicated on the invoice by a specified due date.

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify subscription fees at any time. Any changes to subscription fees will become effective at the end of the current subscription period. We will provide you with reasonable advance notice prior to any change in subscription fees taking effect, allowing you the opportunity to terminate your subscription before such changes become effective. Continuing to use the service after the subscription fee change is effective constitutes your agreement to pay the modified subscription fee amount.

**4.3 Credits**

The Services operate on a credit-based system. Credits may be purchased, earned, or granted through promotions or subscriptions. Each service consumes a predefined number of credits (“**Credits**”) based on complexity, volume, or duration, which is determined at Company’s sole discretion. The platform provider retains full discretion to determine the value of a Credit, including but not limited to, the amount or type of processing, service access, or computational resources each credit enables. Credit consumption rates may vary depending on the type of service accessed, the complexity of the request, the size or length of the input or output, model tier, or any other relevant technical factor. The platform makes no guarantees that a specific number of Credits will yield a fixed quantity or quality of output. The Company reserves the right to modify, increase, or decrease the number of credits required to access specific features, tools, or model capabilities, with or without prior notice. These changes may reflect shifts in system demand, operational costs, new feature releases, or technical upgrades. The platform may classify services into credit tiers (e.g., free, event, daily, monthly, etc.). While the Company may provide users with up-to-date credit usage information, including estimations of consumption, it is not liable for discrepancies between projected and actual usage.

All Credits shall expire in accordance with the [Company’s Credit Policy](https://www.patternautomation.com/credits-policy) as may be updated from time to time. All Credit purchases are final and non-refundable, except where required by law. Upon termination of your account for any reason, unused Credits may be forfeited without compensation. If the Company finds that credits were obtained or used fraudulently, it reserves the right to invalidate those Credits and take appropriate legal action.

Credits may only be used by the account to which they were issued and may not be transferred, resold, or exchanged for cash or other value. The platform reserves the right to adjust credit costs, modify available services, or change the Credit system at any time with or without notice.

**4.4 Refund Policy**

Except where required by applicable law, all payments made for subscriptions, Credits, or other paid features are **final and non-refundable**. You acknowledge that once access to a paid service or Credit has been granted, the Company has fully performed its obligations and no refund will be issued.

The Company may, **at its sole discretion**, consider a partial refund request in exceptional circumstances. If approved, any refund will be calculated **based on the proportion of unused Credits**, excluding any discounts, promotions, or taxes paid. The final determination of eligibility and refund amount rests entirely with the Company.

If you are a consumer residing in the **European Union, the United Kingdom, or Turkey**, you have the right to withdraw from your purchase within 14 days in accordance with applicable consumer protection laws.

Refunds (if approved) will be processed to your original payment method within 1–15 business days, depending on your payment institution’s processing time.

We reserve the rights to refuse the refunds if:

- Your account has been restricted, suspended, or terminated due to policy violations, abuse, or fraud;
- You have already received a prior refund for similar products or services;
- You purchased credits, subscriptions, or other services via promotions, coupons, or discounted pricing; or
- The refund request is made after the applicable period or relates to used Credits or consumed services.

The Company reserves the right to refuse or limit refund requests at its discretion to prevent abuse or excessive refund activity.

If you have any disputes, claims, or controversies arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Services, including claims and disputes that arose before the effective date of these Terms (a **”Dispute”**), you agree to first attempt to resolve the Dispute informally. You and the Company agree to participate in good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an action in small claims court ("**Informal Dispute Resolution**"). To initiate Informal Dispute Resolution, a party must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute ("**Notice**"). Such Notice to the Company should be sent by email to by contacting the Company via email, [info@patternautomation.com](mailto:info@patternautomation.com).  The Company will send any Notice to you via email we have on file associated with your account. To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the Notice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought, and the user name, email address and phone number associated with your account. The Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in Informal Dispute Resolution.

**12.2.2 Dispute Resolution for Non-U.S., Non-UK and European Union (EU) Users**

For any Dispute that is not resolved informally within the 45-day period, and where these Terms do not specify a mandatory dispute resolution process or the local law does not require otherwise, you and the Company agree that any Dispute will be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Estonia International Arbitration Centre (“**EIAC**”) under the Arbitration Rules of the EIAC in force at the time of delivery of the arbitration notice, which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference in this clause.

The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the laws of Estonia, with the seat of arbitration in Estonia, and the language of the proceedings in English. The Tribunal shall consist of a sole arbitrator, to be appointed by mutual agreement of the parties. If the parties are unable to agree on the appointment within thirty (30) days from the date of the delivery of the Notice of Arbitration, the sole arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the EIAC in accordance with the EIAC Rules. The arbitrator shall award only such damages as are permitted under these Terms. Each party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees), and the parties shall equally share the fees and expenses of the arbitrator unless otherwise determined by the arbitrator in the final award.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Terms, either party may always apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an injunction or any other legal or equitable relief.

**12.2.3 Dispute Resolution For UK and EU Users**

If you are a consumer in the UK or European Union, you will benefit from any mandatory provisions of the law of your country of residence and nothing in these Terms shall affect your rights as a consumer to rely on such mandatory provisions of the laws of your country of residence.

In the event of any Dispute, you and Company agree that such individual claim or dispute shall be resolved in the competent court in the country in which you are ordinarily resident, provided such country is in the European Union or United Kingdom.

**12.2.4 Dispute Resolution For U.S. Users**

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT, WAIVES YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL, AND REQUIRES YOU TO PROCEED TO ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS.**

You and the Company agree that any Dispute will be resolved by final and binding arbitration. This arbitration agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, and will be interpreted and enforced accordingly.

**A. INFORMAL DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

Before either party may seek arbitration, the parties agree to attempt to resolve any Dispute informally pursuant to Section 12.2.1. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled for forty-five (45) days from the date that either you or the Company first sends the applicable notice, allowing the parties to engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

**B. BINDING ARBITRATION**

Any Dispute not resolved through the informal dispute resolution process within 60 days shall be resolved by a neutral arbitrator through final and binding arbitration.

The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (”**NAM**”) pursuant to its Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable (available [here](https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/)). The arbitrator will have the authority to grant any remedy or relief that would otherwise be available in a court of law.

**C. EXCEPTIONS**

This section does not require informal dispute resolution or arbitration of the following claims: (i) individual claims brought in small claims court; and (ii) injunctive or other equitable relief to stop unauthorized use or abuse of the Services or intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

**D. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL**

**YOU AND THE COMPANY KNOWINGLY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY**. You and the Company are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under these Terms, except as specified herein.

**E. WAIVER OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS**

**YOU AND THE COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING**. **CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS ARE PROHIBITED**. **ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE.**

**F. BATCH ARBITRATION**

To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and the Company agree that if twenty-five (25) or more claimants, represented by the same or similar counsel or organizations, file demands for arbitration raising substantially similar Disputes within a ninety (90) day period, then NAM shall administer them in batches.

- **Batch Administration:** NAM will administer these demands in batches of up to fifty (50) claimants each (“**Batch**”).
- **Consolidation:** NAM will administer each Batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one arbitrator, one set of arbitration fees due per side per Batch, and one final award for that Batch.
- **Substantially Similar Disputes:** Requests are deemed of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief.

This Batch Arbitration provision shall be interpreted in accordance with NAM’s Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, but shall in no way be interpreted as authorizing a class, collective, or mass arbitration or action of any kind, except as expressly set forth in this provision.

**G. OPT-OUT MECHANISM**

You have the right to opt out of the binding arbitration agreement set forth in this section within thirty (30) days of the date you first accepted these Terms.
