# API Keys

API keys provide secure, programmatic access to NeuroAI platform resources. They enable authentication for automated workflows, integrations, and applications without requiring manual login credentials.

## What are API Keys?

API keys are long-lived access tokens that authenticate requests to NeuroAI services. They act as unique identifiers that verify your identity and determine what actions you can perform within the platform.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How many API keys can I create?">
    There is no strict limit on the number of API keys per account. However, we recommend creating only the keys you need and following the principle of least privilege.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use the same key across multiple environments?">
    While technically possible, it's strongly discouraged. Use separate API keys for development, staging, and production environments for better security and access control.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my API key is compromised?">
    Immediately revoke the compromised key through the dashboard or API. Create a new key with different credentials and update all applications. Review audit logs to assess potential unauthorized access.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do API keys expire?">
    By default, API keys do not expire unless you explicitly set an expiration date during creation. For enhanced security, consider setting expiration dates and implementing regular key rotation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I recover a deleted API key?">
    No, deleted API keys cannot be recovered. You must create a new API key if one is accidentally deleted.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I know which permissions my API key needs?">
    Start with minimal permissions required for your use case. Test thoroughly and add permissions as needed. Review the permissions documentation for detailed information about each role.
