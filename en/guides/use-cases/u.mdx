### 1: Research and Report Writing

**User Request:**

"Prepare a detailed report for me on the impact of quantum computing on cryptography. I need the main concepts, current threats, expert forecasts, and a list of key companies in this field. Format it as a document."

**How Neuro Works:**

- The agent independently launches parallel searches
- Shows key findings in the dialogue in real-time ("Found 5 key threats to RSA encryption. Want to dive deeper?")
- Interactively clarifies details
- Automatically writes a draft report directly in the chat
- Upon completion, offers to format it into .docx

**Key Difference:**

The user never once gave a command like "use search" or "save to file." The entire process was like a dialogue with an analyst assistant.

### Scenario 2: Web Application Development

**User Request:**

"Create a simple React web application that generates an image from a text description using the DALL-E 3 API. Deploy it and give me a link."

**How Neuro Works:**

- The agent determines that a backend is needed for secure API key handling
- Initializes the project
- Writes code for frontend and backend
- Shows it in the dialogue for review
- Requests the API key through secure input
- Builds and deploys the application
- Provides the user with a ready link

**Key Difference:**

A complex process requiring dozens of steps was executed based on a single high-level request. The user acted as a reviewer, not an executor.

### What Can Be Automated

- **Email Management** — summarization, organization, 24/7 inbox management
- **Content Creation** — generating blog posts, social media posts, product descriptions, video content
- **Data Organization** — transforming unstructured data into organized databases and dashboards
- **Research & Monitoring** — daily news digests, competitor tracking, trend monitoring
- **Social Media** — creating content calendars, formatting for different platforms, auto-publishing
- **Report Generation** — automatic creation of daily, weekly, and monthly reports
- **HR & Recruitment** — resume screening, interview process optimization, onboarding
- **Website & Coding** — creating no-code websites, code generation, SEO optimization
