## What is a Neuro AI Use Case?

A use case is a specific problem Neuro AI can solve or a goal it can help you achieve. Unlike traditional chatbots that only answer questions, Neuro AI:

- **Creates** — Generates documents, presentations, code, and content
- **Analyzes** — Processes data and provides insights
- **Automates** — Performs actions in your connected apps
- **Delivers** — Produces ready-to-use results

## The Neuro AI Difference

### Traditional AI Tools

```
User Question → AI Answer → Manual Implementation
```

**Key Distinction:** Neuro AI doesn't just talk—it executes.
