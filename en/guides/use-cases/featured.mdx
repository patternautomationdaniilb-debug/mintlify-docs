I want you to create a 3D model of Neptune using Three.js, similar to the Earth visualization example in our conversation. Follow these steps:  1. Create a project directory structure    - Create a main project folder for the Neptune visualization    - Set up necessary subdirectories (assets, etc.)  2. Gather Neptune textures and information    - Download high-quality Neptune texture maps from NASA/JPL or other space agencies    - Research Neptune's physical characteristics (size, rotation, rings, etc.)    - Find information about Neptune's moons if we want to include them  3. Set up the basic project files    - Create an HTML file with proper structure    - Set up CSS for styling    - Create a JavaScript file for the Three.js implementation  4. Implement the 3D Neptune visualization using Three.js    - Set up the scene, camera, and renderer    - Create a sphere geometry for Neptune    - Apply appropriate textures and materials    - Add lighting to highlight the planet's features    - Implement Neptune's rotation and axial tilt    - Add Neptune's rings as a thin disk geometry    - Optionally add major moons (Triton, etc.)  5. Add interactive features    - Implement camera controls for zooming and rotating the view    - Add UI controls to adjust visualization parameters    - Create options to toggle features (rings, moons, etc.)    - Add information display about Neptune's characteristics  6. Test the visualization    - Set up a local server to test the implementation    - Verify all features work correctly    - Test on different browsers and screen sizes  7. Deploy the visualization    - Deploy to Manus Space for easy sharing    - Provide a permanent URL for access  8. Document the features and how to use them    - Create clear instructions on how to interact with the model    - Include information about Neptune's characteristics    - Document the data sources used  The final result should be an interactive 3D model of Neptune that users can rotate, zoom in/out, and explore with various visualization options. The model should be scientifically accurate based on available data from NASA and other space agencies.

Create presentation slides based on the following instructions:

Analyze the profiles of Chinese researchers who are first or corresponding authors at top U.S.-based AI conferences in the first half of 2025, including ICLR, CVPR, NAACL, and AAAI.

Instructions:

Identify Chinese names (e.g. Zhang, Li, Wang) from the author lists of accepted papers.

For each author, extract:

- Full name
- Affiliation & title (e.g. PhD, professor)
- Research area (e.g. NLP, CV, ML)
- Paper title and conference
- Link to the paper (OpenReview/arXiv/etc.)

Generate a 10-slide presentation summarizing:

- Author stats by conference and field
- Sample author profiles with bios and papers
- Key insights (e.g. most active institutions, trending topics)

Output:

A professional slide deck in English with concise content and visual highlights. Use clear charts and tables to present findings.

Create a short video platform featuring mythical creatures from China's "Classic of Mountains and Seas" (Shan Hai Jing), with vertical scrolling, autoplay, and creature information display to deliver a TikTok-like browsing experience. You need to produce short videos of several seconds for each creature, including visual design, animated movements, and custom sound effects. Requires responsive web design and permanent cloud deployment.

Hi Manus, my name is Daniel and I'm a content creator making videos about guinea pigs to help the viewers take good care of their pets.  My channel on YouTube is  @GuineaPigFacts and it is called The Guinea Pig Facts. I am preparing a new video about the different type of cage use around the world. I have notice some video coming from Asia that the guinea pigs are kept in a cage with their paws directly on a grid without any bedding like fleece or wood chips. I want you to help draft a script by showing the different type of cage floor and bedding use around the world and also what they use in laboratories. I want to be able to show some graphics that will tell the percentage of usage and also map of the world with the different habit. Finally I need to give some advise and warnings about the different type of bedding and cage floor. This video will be narrated by me in the form that I am talking to a friend. Can you help me with that.
