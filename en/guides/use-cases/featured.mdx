I want you to create a 3D model of Neptune using Three.js, similar to the Earth visualization example in our conversation. Follow these steps:  1. Create a project directory structure    - Create a main project folder for the Neptune visualization    - Set up necessary subdirectories (assets, etc.)  2. Gather Neptune textures and information    - Download high-quality Neptune texture maps from NASA/JPL or other space agencies    - Research Neptune's physical characteristics (size, rotation, rings, etc.)    - Find information about Neptune's moons if we want to include them  3. Set up the basic project files    - Create an HTML file with proper structure    - Set up CSS for styling    - Create a JavaScript file for the Three.js implementation  4. Implement the 3D Neptune visualization using Three.js    - Set up the scene, camera, and renderer    - Create a sphere geometry for Neptune    - Apply appropriate textures and materials    - Add lighting to highlight the planet's features    - Implement Neptune's rotation and axial tilt    - Add Neptune's rings as a thin disk geometry    - Optionally add major moons (Triton, etc.)  5. Add interactive features    - Implement camera controls for zooming and rotating the view    - Add UI controls to adjust visualization parameters    - Create options to toggle features (rings, moons, etc.)    - Add information display about Neptune's characteristics  6. Test the visualization    - Set up a local server to test the implementation    - Verify all features work correctly    - Test on different browsers and screen sizes  7. Deploy the visualization    - Deploy to Manus Space for easy sharing    - Provide a permanent URL for access  8. Document the features and how to use them    - Create clear instructions on how to interact with the model    - Include information about Neptune's characteristics    - Document the data sources used  The final result should be an interactive 3D model of Neptune that users can rotate, zoom in/out, and explore with various visualization options. The model should be scientifically accurate based on available data from NASA and other space agencies.

Create presentation slides based on the following instructions:

Analyze the profiles of Chinese researchers who are first or corresponding authors at top U.S.-based AI conferences in the first half of 2025, including ICLR, CVPR, NAACL, and AAAI.

Instructions:

Identify Chinese names (e.g. Zhang, Li, Wang) from the author lists of accepted papers.

For each author, extract:

- Full name

- Affiliation & title (e.g. PhD, professor)

- Research area (e.g. NLP, CV, ML)

- Paper title and conference

- Link to the paper (OpenReview/arXiv/etc.)

Generate a 10-slide presentation summarizing:

- Author stats by conference and field

- Sample author profiles with bios and papers

- Key insights (e.g. most active institutions, trending topics)

Output:

A professional slide deck in English with concise content and visual highlights. Use clear charts and tables to present findings.
