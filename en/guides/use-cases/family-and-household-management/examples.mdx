I need a 7-day Japan itinerary for April 15-23 from Seattle, with a \$2500-5000 budget for my fiancée and

me. We love historical sites, hidden gems, and Japanese culture (kendo, tea ceremonies, Zen

meditation). We want to see Nara&#39;s deer and explore cities on foot. I plan to propose during this trip and

need a special location recommendation. Please provide a detailed itinerary and a simple HTML travel

handbook with maps, attraction descriptions, essential Japanese phrases, and travel tips we can

reference throughout our journey.
