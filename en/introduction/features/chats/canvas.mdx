## **What is Design View?**

Design View is an integrated feature that allows for complex, multi-step visual workflows. Instead of starting from scratch with every new prompt, you can make precise edits to existing images, ensuring consistency and saving valuable time. Whether you’re designing a poster, creating a mood board, or refining a product shot, Design View acts as your creative partner, understanding your intent from start to finish. It is powered by Google’s advanced Nano Banana Pro image generation model, ensuring high-quality, photorealistic results.

**How to Use Design View**

Using Design View is an intuitive process that combines simple prompts with powerful editing tools. 

## Here’s how you can get started:

**Step 1: Generate Your Initial Concept**

Begin by giving Neuro a simple prompt to generate your base image.

```text

```

**Step 2: Refine with the Mark Tool**

Once you have your initial image, you can use it to make precise edits. Instead of writing a new prompt and hoping for the best, you can select specific elements and provide instructions for how to change them.

1. Click the **[Mark]** tool in the Design View interface. 2. Select the element you want to modify (e.g., a sofa, a plant, a window). 3. Provide a clear and concise instruction for the change.

For example:

\* Select the sofa:`Change this to a muted sage green.`\* Select the plant:`Change this to a wildflower arrangement.`\* Select the window:`Change the leaves to autumn foliage.`

2. Reference Images: You can add elements to your design by providing a reference image. For example, you can add a specific lamp to a room by uploading an image of it.

**Step 3: Edit Text Elements**

If your design includes text, such as on a poster or in an infographic, you can easily edit it without disturbing the rest of the image. Click on\*\*“edit text”\*\*and Neuro will extract all text elements, allowing you to make changes with ease.

### [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/features/design-view#mobile-editing)

**Mobile Editing**

Design View is web version also available and later on the Neuro mobile app, so you can continue your work on the go.

**Press and Hold to Mark**: Simply press and hold on any area of an image to create a selection.

**Voice or Text Input**: Once an area is marked, you can either type your changes or use your voice to record instructions.\
**Batch Your Edits**: Mark multiple areas on an image, add an instruction for each, and send them all to be processed in a single batch.

**What You Need to Know**

**Integrated Workflow**: Design View is not a standalone tool; it is an integrated capability of the Neuro agent. This allows for a seamless transition between generating ideas, refining visuals, and incorporating them into larger projects.

**Precision and Control**: The Mark Tool gives you a level of control that is not possible with traditional prompting. You can change specific elements of an image without affecting the overall composition, lighting, or style.

**Tips for Better Results**

| :------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be Specific with Instructions**     | When using the Mark Tool, provide clear and direct instructions. For example, instead of saying “make this better,” say “change the color to a deep blue.” |
| **Use High-Quality Reference Images** | When adding elements from a reference image, use a high-quality image with a clear subject for the best results.                                           |
| **Start with a Good Base Image**      | The better your initial image, the easier it will be to refine. Spend some time crafting a good initial prompt to get a strong starting point.             |
| **Iterate and Refine**                | Don’t be afraid to make multiple small changes to get your image just right. The power of Design View is in its iterative workflow.                        |
