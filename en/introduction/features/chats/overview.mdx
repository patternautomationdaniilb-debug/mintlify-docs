## Multiple LLM Model Selection

NeuroAI gives you access to multiple AI models, each optimized for different use cases:

## **Available Models are inside NeuroAI**

Most users can stick with the default model (North Star), but you can switch models by selecting from the model dropdown menu in the chat interface. Each model has different strengths, so choose based on your specific task.

---

## Custom Agents: Your Specialized AI Team

Instead of talking to a generic AI, you can invoke **Custom Agents**—specialized AI workers with specific expertise, communication styles, and capabilities.

### What are Custom Agents?

Custom Agents are AI workers you create or use from the Agent Store. Each agent has:

"@CompetitiveIntelligence track our top 5 competitors"
```

Mentions isn't available, but will be soon.

**Benefits of Custom Agents:**

- ✓ Specialized expertise for specific tasks

our top competitors weekly, tracks product updates, pricing 
changes, and strategic moves, and delivers executive summaries."
```

## Scheduled Tasks: Automate Recurring Work

One of NeuroAI's most powerful features is **Scheduled Tasks**—the ability to automate recurring work by having agents execute tasks on a predefined schedule.

### What are Scheduled Tasks?

Scheduled Tasks let you set up recurring workflows that run automatically:

- **Daily reports** — News summaries, metrics updates, monitoring
- **Weekly analysis** — Competitor tracking, performance reviews
- **Monthly reports** — Analytics dashboards, business reviews
- **One-time tasks** — Delayed execution for future needs

**Think of it as:** Hiring an AI assistant that works on autopilot, executing the same task every day, week, or month without you needing to remember.

### How Scheduled Tasks Work

**Step 1: Describe the Task**

Be specific about what you want done:

```
"Every Monday at 8 AM, research our top 5 competitors 
and send me a summary of any product updates, pricing 
changes, or news from the past week"
```

**Step 2: Specify the Schedule**

Define when and how often:

- **Daily:** "Every day at 9 AM"
- **Weekly:** "Every Friday at 5 PM"
- **Monthly:** "On the 1st of every month at 9 AM"
- **One-time:** "Tomorrow at 3 PM"

**Step 3: Define Output Destination**

Choose how to receive results:

- Email summary
- Slack notification
- Google Drive document
- Notion database entry
- Multiple destinations

**Step 4: Assign an Agent**

Connect the task to a Custom Agent with relevant expertise:

- Daily news → "Industry Analyst" agent
- Competitor research → "Competitive Intelligence Officer" agent
- Analytics report → "Data Analyst" agent

### Real-World Scheduled Task Examples

#### Example 1: Daily Industry News Digest

**Configuration:**

- Schedule: Every weekday at 7 AM
- Agent: "Industry Analyst"

**Task:**

```
"Research AI industry news from the past 24 hours. 
Focus on funding announcements, product launches, 
partnerships, and regulatory developments.

Deliver as:
- 5-bullet summary with sources
- Email to my inbox
- Keep to 2-minute read time"
```

**Result:** Every morning, a curated AI news summary in your inbox before work starts.

---

#### Example 2: Weekly Competitor Intelligence

**Configuration:**

**Task:**

```

[List competitors]

- Press releases and announcements

Deliver as:
- Comparison table showing all changes
- Highlight significant moves
- Include URLs to source materials

Save to:
- Google Drive shared folder
- Slack #competitive-intel channel"
```

**Result:** Comprehensive competitive update every Friday covering all monitored competitors.

---

#### Example 3: Monthly Analytics Report

**Configuration:**

- Schedule: 1st of every month at 9 AM
- Agent: "Data Analyst"

**Task:**

```
"Analyze website traffic from last month.

Data to Include:
- Monthly visitor trends (vs. previous month)

```

**Result:** On the 1st of each month, a comprehensive analytics dashboard posted to your team.

---

#### Example 4: Daily Social Media Monitoring

**Configuration:**

- Schedule: Every day at 10 AM
- Agent: "Social Media Manager"

**Task:**

```
"Monitor social media for mentions of:
- Our company name
- Our product name
- Key industry hashtags
- Competitor brands

Focus on:
- Twitter/X mentions
- Reddit discussions
- LinkedIn posts
- Industry forums

Deliver:
- 10 most relevant mentions

```

### Managing Scheduled Tasks

**View All Tasks:**

- Navigate to Settings → Scheduled Tasks
- See all active, paused, and completed tasks
- Review execution history

**Edit a Task:**

**Delete a Task:**

- Consider pausing instead of deleting

### Best Practices for Scheduled Tasks

#### 1. Be Specific About Timing

❌ Vague: "In the morning" ✅ Specific: "Every weekday at 8 AM EST"

#### 2. Define Clear Outputs

❌ Unclear: "Let me know what you find" ✅ Clear: "Email me a 5-bullet summary to [[email@company.com](mailto:email@company.com)]"

#### 3. Include Time Ranges for Research

❌ Ambiguous: "Research recent news" ✅ Specific: "News from the past 24 hours only"

#### 4. Test Before Scheduling

1. Run the task manually once
2. Review the output quality
3. Make adjustments
4. Then schedule it

#### 5. Set Realistic Expectations

- **Simple tasks:** 3-5 minutes
- **Medium tasks:** 5-15 minutes
- **Complex tasks:** 15-30 minutes

**Tip:** Schedule complex tasks at times when you don't need immediate results.

- Brainstorm ideas and refine your vision
- Ask questions and explore options
- Analyze documents before creating content
- Research topics before building deliverables

Then switch to Agent Mode when ready to create.

---

### 2. Be Specific in Your Requests

**Vague requests lead to generic results:** ❌ "Make a presentation about AI" ❌ "Create some marketing materials" ❌ "Research competitors"

**Specific requests produce quality results:** ✅ "Create a 15-slide investor pitch deck for our AI customer service platform targeting enterprise clients. Include market research and competitive analysis." ✅ "Design an Instagram carousel post (5 slides) promoting our summer sale with vibrant colors and bold typography." ✅ "Research the top 10 SaaS project management tools, compare pricing and features, and create a competitive analysis table."

**Benefits:**

- Agent brings specialized expertise
- Consistent quality and style
- Pre-configured for specific workflows
- Saves time explaining requirements

---

Don't research separately—combine it:

❌ **Separate workflow:**

```
1. "Research AI trends"
2. [Review research]
3. "Now create a presentation"
```

✅ **Combined workflow:**

```
"Research AI automation trends in 2025, then create

and emerging opportunities. Include citations for all 
statistics."
```

**Result:** Research flows directly into your deliverable.

---

### 5. Automate Recurring Work with Scheduled Tasks

If you find yourself doing the same task weekly or monthly:

❌ **Manual repetition:**

- Monday: "Research competitor news"
- Next Monday: "Research competitor news"
- Repeat forever...

✅ **Schedule it once:**

```
"Every Monday at 8 AM, research our top 5 competitors 
for product updates and news from the past week. 
Email me a summary."
```

**Result:** Set it once, receive updates forever.

---

### 6. Use Templates for Brand Consistency
