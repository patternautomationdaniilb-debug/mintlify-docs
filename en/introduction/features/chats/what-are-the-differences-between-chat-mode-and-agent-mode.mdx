## **Chat Mode: For Instant Answers and In-depth Discussions**

Chat mode is a lightweight mode we offer, allowing users to get instant answers under this mode. In chat mode, Manus supports recognizing images, PDFs, and text files. It also supports online searches to provide users with better answers. And conversations conducted in this mode will not consume credits.

With the release of Manus 1.6, Chat Mode has been significantly enhanced with the integration of fast and efficient chat models in the industry. This allows it to easily handle various complex tasks such as daily conversations, in-depth discussions, and brainstorming, providing more accurate and comprehensive responses.

## **Agent Mode: For Complex Tasks and Autonomous Workflows**

Agent mode supports users in performing more complex tasks, including creating websites, slides, videos, and so on. In this mode, Manus will autonomously plan and complete tasks based on your instructions. Tasks using this mode will consume credits since Manus executes a wider variety of more complex tasks and delivers various outcomes in this mode. Manus 1.6 introduces significant improvements to Agent Mode, especially in the MAX version.

**_\*Please note that Free users only have access to Manus 1.6 Lite in Agent Mode, while Pro users have access to Manus 1.6, Manus 1.6 Max, and Manus 1.6 Lite. Both Free and Pro users have access to Chat Mode._**

These enhancements include:

- Improved Core Capabilities: Better planning, problem-solving, and the ability to find optimal solutions.
- Mobile App Development: In addition to websites, Agent Mode can now develop mobile applications.
- Higher Success Rate: The success rate for web development and other complex tasks has been greatly improved.
