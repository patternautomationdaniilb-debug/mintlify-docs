## **What is AI Docs?**

- **Smart AI assistance** — Latest LLMs support document generation and modification through interactive prompts
- **Dual format support** — Rich Text and Markdown formats meet different professional needs
- **Automated design intelligence** — Automatically applies professional design principles, typography hierarchies, and logical structure
- **Visual integration** — Upload images for AI to analyze aesthetic elements and create visually cohesive documents
- **Flexible export** — HTML, Word and PDF formats for instant sharing and collaboration

## **Quick Start**

Get started in four simple steps:

1. **Go to AI Docs**

   From the Genspark homepage, click "AI Docs" at the bottom, or select "AI Docs" from the "New" menu in the sidebar.
2. **Choose your format**

   Select "Rich Text" for business reports, marketing materials, and presentations with visual editing, or "Markdown" for technical docs, project documentation, and API docs with code highlighting.
3. **Describe your needs**

   Tell AI what you want to create — a resume, report, contract, or any document type. Here are some sample prompts:

   ```
   Create a professional resume for a software engineer position based on my LinkedIn profile
   ```

   Try this

   ```
   Design a menu for a boutique coffee shop with coffee, tea, and dessert categories
   ```

   Try this

   ```
   Convert this handwritten class schedule to a formatted electronic document
   ```

   Try this
4. **Get results**

   AI Docs automatically generates your document with proper structure and formatting. You can then refine through conversation, make manual edits, and export to Word or PDF formats. The system automatically creates "Save Points" for version tracking.

## **Feature Guide**

### **AI Edit**

Select any text for precise AI editing without regenerating the entire document.

1. Select text with your mouse — selected content appears above the chat box
2. Enter your instruction, such as:
   - "Rewrite this in a more professional tone"
   - "Expand this section with specific examples"
   - "Translate this paragraph to Spanish"
   - "Make this more concise"
3. Apply to let AI rewrite the selected content

### **Manual Edit**

You can make direct edits in the "Rich Text" or "Markdown" editor to adjust text formatting, layout, and insert elements like links, images, and tables.

Click the expand icon in the top right corner to enter full-screen editing mode for a better editing experience.

### **Version Management**

AI Docs uses a Save Point system to track every modification:

- **AI edits:** Each AI modification creates a new Save Point automatically
- **Manual edits:** Multiple manual changes are intelligently merged into one version
- **Complete tracking:** Every Save Point captures the full document state and modification information

**Here's how to use Save Points:**

1. Click version dropdown in upper left corner of editor
2. View all historical versions (reverse chronological order)
3. Select any version to preview its content
4. Click "Rollback to" to restore your document to that version

**Here are some common scenarios:**

- **Recover deleted content** — Find the Save Point before deletion, preview to confirm, then rollback
- **Compare different approaches** — Try version B with AI, compare it with version A, rollback if needed, or try version C
- **Track document evolution** — Review how your document was refined step by step through each Save Point

### **Format Conversion**

You can switch between "Rich Text" and "Markdown" formats by clicking the format switch button in the chat box. The system automatically preserves your content structure during conversion.

Here’s what happens during conversions:

- **Rich Text → Markdown:**
  - Extracts document structure and content
  - Converts visual styles to Markdown syntax
  - Maintains images and media as link references
- **Markdown → Rich Text:**
  - Renders Markdown syntax as visual formatted content
  - Preserves document hierarchy and structure
  - Enables advanced styling and layout options

### **Template Library**

We provide hundreds of professional templates covering job applications, business communications, reports and analysis, legal and finance, creative and marketing, event planning, and more.

You can select a template on the AI Docs homepage, enter your prompt to customize content, or use "Manual Edit" or "AI Edit" to refine your document.

### **Share & Export**

- **Share:** Click "Share" in the top right corner, adjust permission settings, and share your project link
- **Export:** Click the Export button in the top right corner, select HTML, Word or PDF format, and download your document

## **FAQ**

### **Q: Should I choose Rich Text or Markdown?**

Choose "Rich Text" if you need beautiful layout and visual editing; choose "Markdown" if you focus on content, need version control, or write technical documentation.

### **Q: Is AI-generated content accurate?**

AI uses the latest large model technology with high accuracy, but we recommend human review of key information.

### **Q: How long can a document be generated at once?**

There's no strict limit, but we recommend generating complex documents in segments for better quality control.

### **Q: Can I recover my current work after rolling back to a previous version?**

No, when you rollback to a previous version, all changes made after that version will be lost and cannot be recovered. Make sure to review the version carefully before confirming the rollback.

### **Q: How to delete unwanted Save Points?**

Currently the system automatically manages all historical records to ensure complete version tracking.
