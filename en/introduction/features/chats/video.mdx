**What can Neuro's video generation feature do?**

Neuro transforms your prompts into complete video stories. They are structured, sequenced, and ready to watch. With a single prompt, Neuro plans each scene, crafts the visuals, and animates your vision. From storyboard creation to concept visualization. Your ideas become living videos in minutes.

Currently, Neuro offers users two video generation models. Our default model supports generating videos in various formats, such as 16:9, 9:16, and 1:1. Using the default model to generate videos consumes 30 credits per second. Users can also choose the Veo 3 model and others, which provides better results but comes with higher costs. The Veo 3 model only supports generating videos in a 16:9 format.
