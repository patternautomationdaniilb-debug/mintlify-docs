## **Pro Tips**

### **Invoking Custom Agents Within Super Agent**

Type @ in a conversation to invoke Custom Agents. You can combine multiple agents to collaboratively complete complex tasks.

For example, when drafting an investment report, you can sequentially invoke a Financial Analysis Custom Agent and an Industry Research Custom Agent, then have Super Agent synthesize a complete report.

### **Optimizing Instructions Through Conversation**

Describe your requirements in natural language in the Create page dialog—the system will automatically update the Instructions.

**Key Elements**:

- **Role Definition**: Clearly specify professional identity
- **Output Format**: Specify presentation style (e.g., tables, sections)
- **Behavioral Boundaries**: Set response scope

Test in Preview after each modification and continuously refine until satisfied.

### **Leveraging Conversation Starters to Guide Users**

Conversation Starters help users understand how to interact with your agent.

Adjust using prompts on the Create page, or manually edit the Conversation Starters text box at the bottom of the left panel on the Configure page.

## **FAQ**

### **Q: How can I make the agent’s responses more accurate?**

Use structured prompts to clearly define roles and tasks, enhance Instructions with detailed guidance, test in Preview, and continuously optimize.

### **Q: Can a deleted agent be recovered?**

No, deletion is permanent. We recommend exporting the conversation history from agent creation before deleting.

### **Q: Can I edit agents from the Agent Store?**

No, favorited agents can only be used—you cannot view or edit their instructions.

### **Q: If I use someone else's shared Custom Agent, will my chat history be leaked?**

No. Each user’s conversation history is completely isolated, and creators cannot view other users’ conversations. Sharing only includes basic information like name and description—Instructions and conversation data are not included.
