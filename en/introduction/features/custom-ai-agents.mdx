Think of Custom Agents as:

- **Specialized expertise** — Focused on one job
- **Instant creation** — No coding required
- **Reusable** — Use anytime via chat
- **Shareable** — Build once, share with others
- **Community-driven** — Discover amazing agents built by others

in tech startup valuations. You have 15 years of 
experience in venture capital."

"You are helpful and knowledgeable"

```

**What the agent actually does**

```
Good:
"Your job is to:
1. Analyze financial statements
2. Benchmark against industry standards
3. Identify growth opportunities
4. Provide valuation estimates
5. Flag risk factors"

Why it matters:
- Keeps agent focused
- Prevents scope creep
- Ensures consistency
```

#### 3. Output Standards

**How the agent presents information**

```
Good:
"Format responses as:
- Executive Summary (1 paragraph)
- Key Findings (5 bullet points)
- Data Table (if numeric)
- Recommendations (3 items)
- Sources (citations required)"

Why it matters:
