## Overview

Apps enable your custom agents to access external tools, search data, and take actions across your entire tech stack. Instead of being limited to conversation, agents can:

- 🔍 **Search** — Find information from connected services
- 📊 **Reference** — Pull real-time data into responses
- 🚀 **Take Actions** — Create tasks, send messages, update records
- 🎯 **Deep Research** — Analyze multiple sources with citations
- ⚡ **Integrate** — Connect to 500+ business tools

---

## How Apps Work With Custom Agents

### Agent Capabilities With Apps

When you configure apps for a custom agent, it gains access to those services:

```
Agent Request:
"Search our CRM for accounts in healthcare"

With Apps Enabled:
→ Agent accesses Salesforce via app
→ Searches for matching accounts
→ Returns results with relevant data

Without Apps:
→ Agent responds with generic knowledge
→ No access to actual company data
→ Limited to training data
```

```

### Step 3: Configure Permissions

```

### Step 4: Test Agent Workflows

```
Before deploying:

4. Is authentication valid?

Solution:
1. Verify app is installed
2. Add app to agent config
3. Grant necessary permissions
4. Re-authenticate if needed
```

### Slow App Performance

```
Issue: Agent waiting for app response

Causes:
- App service is slow
- Network connection issue
- Large data request
- Rate limits hit

Solutions:
- Check app status
- Retry the request
- Make requests more specific
- Optimize data access
```

### Agent Not Taking Actions

```
Issue: Agent can't write to app

Check:
1. Does agent have write permission?
2. Is authentication valid?
3. Is the action possible in app?
4. Are there validation errors?

Solution:
1. Grant write permissions
2. Re-authenticate
3. Verify action format

   → Check if company exists
   → Create if needed

Step 4: Gmail App
   → Draft personalized email

Step 5: Slack App

```

### Conditional App Usage

Configure agents to use different apps based on conditions:

```
Example: Smart Support Agent

IF ticket category is billing:
   → Use Stripe app
   → Check payment history
   → Offer solutions

IF ticket category is technical:
   → Use Jira app
   → Check known issues
   → Create bug report

IF ticket category is product:

Primary: Salesforce (full data)
Fallback: HubSpot (alternative data)
If both fail: Use knowledge base

Notification: Alert team in Slack
Escalation: Create task for manual review
Recovery: Retry on next interaction
```
