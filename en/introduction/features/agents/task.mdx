## What are Neuro Scheduled Tasks?

**Scheduled Tasks** let you automate recurring work by having Neuro agents execute tasks on a predefined schedule. Set it once, configure it properly, and your agents handle it automatically—daily reports, weekly research, monthly analysis, or any recurring workflow.

Think of Scheduled Tasks as automated assistants that run on your calendar. Instead of manually running the same task weekly or daily, your agents execute it automatically at the exact time you specify.

---

## Why Use Scheduled Tasks?

### The Problem with Manual Recurring Work

Without Scheduled Tasks, recurring work means:

- Remember to run the same task daily or weekly
- Manually trigger the same workflow repeatedly
- Risk forgetting to run important tasks
- Inconsistent timing and quality
- Distraction from important work

### The Scheduled Tasks Solution

With Scheduled Tasks, you get:

✅ **Automation** — Tasks run automatically at set times\
✅ **Consistency** — Same time, same quality, every execution\
✅ **Reliability** — Never miss a deadline or update\
✅ **Time savings** — Reclaim hours per week\
✅ **Focus** — Stop thinking about repetitive work

---

## Quick Start: Three Ways to Use Scheduled Tasks

### One-Time Task (Tomorrow)

```
Ask Neuro

"Run this task tomorrow at 9 AM: 
Research top AI news from the past 24 hours 
and email me a summary"
```

**When to use:** Tasks that need to happen later today or tomorrow, but not recurring.

### Recurring Task (Weekly)

```
Ask Neuro

"Every Monday at 8 AM, research our top 5 competitors 
and send me a summary of any product updates or news 
from the past week"
```

**When to use:** Regular weekly tasks like competitor monitoring, report generation, or updates.

### Complex Schedule (Monthly)

```
Ask Neuro

"On the 1st of every month, analyze our website traffic data, 
create a report with key insights, and post it to our Notion database"
```

**When to use:** Monthly reports, billing cycles, or regular complex analysis.

---

## How to Set Up Scheduled Tasks

### Step 1: Describe the Task Clearly

Be specific about what you want the agent to do. Vague descriptions lead to vague results.

```
❌ Too Vague:
"Monitor competitors daily"

✅ Specific:
"Every weekday at 9 AM, check these 5 competitors 
for: product updates, pricing changes, job postings, 
and press releases. Create a comparison table 
and email me the results."
```

### Step 2: Specify the Schedule

Define exactly when and how often the task should run:

**Daily Options**

```
"Every day at 9 AM"
"Every weekday at 8 AM"
"Every weekday and Saturday at 6 AM"
```

"Create a new sheet with monthly summary"
```

**Multiple Outputs**

```
"Email me a summary AND post to Slack #leadership"
"Create a report, save to Drive, and post to Notion"
```

### Step 4: Assign the Right Persona

Connect the task to a custom Persona that has relevant expertise:

```
Persona Assignment Examples:

Daily News Task → "Industry Analyst" Persona

## Best Practices for Scheduled Tasks

### 1. Be Specific About Timing ✅

```
❌ Vague:
"In the morning"
"When you get a chance"

✅ Specific:
"Every weekday at 8 AM EST"
"Every Monday at 9:00 AM Pacific"
"On the 1st of the month at 6 AM UTC"
```

**Why it matters:** Vague timing leads to inconsistent execution. Specific times ensure predictable, reliable automation.

### 2. Define Clear Outputs ✅

```
❌ Unclear:
"Let me know what you find"
"Send me something about competitors"

✅ Clear:
"Email me a 5-bullet summary to [email@company.com]"
"Post a comparison table to Slack #competitive-intel"
"Create a slide deck and save to Google Drive /Reports folder"
```

**Why it matters:** Clear output specifications ensure you get results in the format you need.

### 3. Include Time Ranges for Research ✅

```
❌ Ambiguous:
"Research recent news"
"Find new information"

✅ Specific:
"News from the past 24 hours only"
"Updates since last week's report"
"New developments from last 30 days"
"Products released in the past month"
```

**Why it matters:** Time ranges prevent duplicate research and ensure fresh, relevant data.

### 4. Test Before Scheduling ✅

```
Testing Process:

Step 1: Run the task manually once
→ Ask Neuro to execute the task now

Step 2: Review the output
→ Check format, quality, and completeness

Step 3: Make adjustments
→ Request changes to the description

Step 4: Then schedule it
→ Once you're happy, set up the schedule
```

**Why it matters:** Testing prevents surprises when the task runs automatically.

### 5. Set Realistic Time Expectations ✅

```
Typical Execution Times:

Simple tasks: 3-5 minutes
- News summary
- Price tracking
- Basic research

Medium tasks: 5-15 minutes
- Competitor analysis
- Market research
- Report compilation

Complex tasks: 15-30 minutes
- Deep analysis
- Multiple data sources
- Comprehensive reports
```

**Scheduling tip:** Schedule complex tasks at times when you don't need immediate results.

### 6. Use Specific Data Ranges ✅

```
❌ Vague:
"Analyze our data"
"Check for changes"

✅ Specific:
"Analyze data from the past 7 days"
"Compare to last month's numbers"
"Show changes week-over-week"
"Report on days 1-15 vs days 16-30"
```

### 7. Include Format Requirements ✅

```
Format Specifications:

"Create a table with columns:
- Company name
- Product name
- Launch date
- Key features
- Estimated price

Include charts showing:
- Market adoption trends
- Competitor positioning
- Feature comparison"
```

### 8. Set Quality Standards ✅

```
Quality Guidelines:

"All statistics must be:
- Cited with sources
- From 2024-2025 only
- Verified from at least 2 sources
- Current as of execution date"

"Analysis should:
- Include competitive implications
- Highlight market shifts
- Flag emerging threats
- Suggest strategic responses"
```

## Troubleshooting Scheduled Tasks

### Task Didn't Execute

**Check These:**

1. Is the schedule enabled? (View in Settings)
2. Did the time pass? (Check current time vs. scheduled time)
3. Is the Persona available? (Check Persona status)
4. Any errors in execution history? (View details)

**Solution:** Check execution history for error details, adjust task description if needed.

### Output Not Received

**Check These:**

1. Is output destination correct? (Email address, Slack channel, Drive folder)
2. Do you have permissions? (Slack access, Drive access)
3. Check spam folder? (Email may be filtered)
4. Check Slack app notifications? (May be muted)

**Solution:** Verify output destination settings, check access permissions.

### Output Quality Poor

**Check These:**

1. Is task description clear? (Vague descriptions → vague output)
2. Is Persona appropriate? (Right expertise for the task?)
3. Are requirements specific? (Details matter for quality)

**Solution:** Edit task description to be more specific, try different Persona.

### Schedule Executing Too Frequently

**Check This:**

1. Schedule timing correct? (Did you mean daily or weekly?)

**Solution:** Edit schedule, verify frequency is what you intended.

### Task Taking Too Long

**Check This:**

1. Is task too complex? (Break into smaller tasks)
2. Are research requirements too extensive? (Narrow the scope)

**Solution:** Simplify task requirements, break into multiple smaller tasks.

---

## Tips for Optimal Scheduled Task Performance

### Timing Strategy

```
Best Times by Task Type:

Early Morning (6-8 AM):
- Price tracking (before market changes)
- News summaries (catch overnight developments)
- Competitor updates

Mid-Morning (9-11 AM):
- Research tasks (fresh results)
- Market analysis
- Content curation

End of Day (4-5 PM):
- Daily summaries (full day data)
- Team reports (captures day's activity)

Off-Hours (11 PM):
- Heavy analysis (no impact on performance)
- Large data processing
- Extensive research

Avoid (Peak Hours):
- 12-1 PM (lunch time)
- 3-4 PM (end of business day rush)
```

### Task Complexity Strategy

```
Simple Tasks (3-5 min):
→ Schedule multiple times daily
→ Can handle any time
→ Low resource impact

Medium Tasks (5-15 min):
→ Schedule once or twice daily
→ Best during off-peak hours
→ Moderate resource usage

Complex Tasks (15-30+ min):
→ Schedule once daily or less
→ Best scheduled for off-hours
→ High resource usage
```

### Optimization Tips

```
1. Batch Similar Tasks
Group related monitoring tasks at same time
→ Runs more efficiently
→ Easier to manage

2. Stagger Large Tasks
Don't run multiple heavy tasks simultaneously
→ Schedule 30 minutes apart
→ Ensures quality execution

3. Monitor Execution History
Review past runs regularly
→ Identify patterns
→ Adjust as needed

4. Test After Changes
After editing a schedule, verify first execution
→ Ensure changes worked
→ Catch issues early

5. Clean Up Old Tasks
Delete obsolete scheduled tasks
→ Reduce clutter
→ Prevent confusion
```
