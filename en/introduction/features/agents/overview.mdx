## Layer 5: Knowledge Base

### What is a Knowledge Base?

A Knowledge Base is a custom repository of information that informs how your Neuro agents work. Instead of using generic knowledge, your agents reference your Knowledge Base to understand your business, preferences, processes, and expertise.

Think of a Knowledge Base as the "institutional library" for your AI team. It contains everything your agents need to know to work effectively: company values, industry expertise, best practices, standard operating procedures, brand guidelines, and customer information.

### Why Build a Knowledge Base?

#### The Problem Without a Knowledge Base

Without a Knowledge Base, your agents:

- ✗ Don't know your company's specific processes
- ✗ Don't understand your industry expertise
- ✗ Can't maintain consistent brand voice
- ✗ Make generic recommendations
- ✗ Require detailed explanations for every task
- ✗ Miss context about your business

#### The Knowledge Base Solution

With a Knowledge Base, your agents:

- ✓ Understand your business — Know your market, products, and strategy
- ✓ Follow your processes — Execute work your way consistently
- ✓ Maintain your brand — Write and communicate like your company
- ✓ Provide relevant insights — Make recommendations based on your context
- ✓ Work independently — Need less explanation per task
- ✓ Improve over time — Learn from your feedback and updates

### Knowledge Base Best Practices

#### 1. Keep Information Current ✅

**Update Schedule:**

- **Strategic Information:** Quarterly
- **Operational Information:** Monthly
- **Product Information:** As-needed
- **Market & Research:** Continuously

#### 2. Make Information Specific ✅

❌ **Too Vague:**

```
"We believe in customer success"
"Our product is best-in-class"
"We compete on quality"
```

✅ **Specific:**

```
"Customer success means 90% of customers achieve 
their stated ROI goal within 90 days. We measure 
this through quarterly business reviews and track 
against our NPS of 65+."

"Our product is best-in-class because:
- 40% faster implementation than Zapier
- 10x cheaper than UiPath
- 3x more powerful than Make
- Built for enterprise reliability"
```

#### 3. Include Examples ✅

**Without Examples:**

```
"Our sales process focuses on understanding 
customer needs and demonstrating product fit."
```

**With Examples:**

```
"Our sales process:
1. Discovery call (30 min)
   Example: 'Tell me about your biggest operational bottleneck'
   
2. Product demo (45 min)
   Example: Show how customers automated invoice processing
   
3. Trial (1 week)
   Example: Customers typically process 1000+ documents
   
4. Close (2-4 weeks)
   Example: ROI presentation shows $200K+ annual savings"
```

#### 4. Cross-Reference Documents ✅

**Linking Strategy:**

Document: "Sales Process" Links to:

- → Messaging Framework (what to say)
- → Company Positioning (why we're different)
- → Competitive Intelligence (competitive talking points)
- → Customer Success Metrics (what success looks like)
- → Contract Templates (standard terms)

#### 5. Use Consistent Terminology ✅

**Define & Use Consistently:**

```
Term: "Enterprise Customer"
Definition: "Companies with 1000+ employees 
and $500M+ revenue"

Term: "Mid-Market Customer"
Definition: "Companies with 100-1000 employees 
and $20M-$500M revenue"

Term: "SMB Customer"
Definition: "Companies with <100 employees 
and <$20M revenue"
```

Use these exact definitions consistently throughout your Knowledge Base and agent communications.

### Integration with Personas

#### How Knowledge Base Supports Personas

**Persona:** "Enterprise Sales Strategist"

**Knowledge Base Documents Used:**

- Company positioning (what to say)
- Enterprise customer profile (who to talk to)
- Sales process (how to sell)
- Competitive intelligence (how we differentiate)
- Messaging framework (specific language)
- Case studies (proof points)
- ROI framework (how to calculate value)

**Result:** Agent can create enterprise sales strategies without manual briefing, using company-specific context from Knowledge Base.

## Layer 6: Scheduled Tasks (Automation)

### What are Scheduled Tasks?

Scheduled Tasks let you automate recurring work by having Neuro agents execute tasks on a predefined schedule. Set it once, configure it properly, and your agents handle it automatically—daily reports, weekly research, monthly analysis, or any recurring workflow.

Think of Scheduled Tasks as automated assistants that run on your calendar. Instead of manually running the same task weekly or daily, your agents execute it automatically at the exact time you specify.

### Why Use Scheduled Tasks?

#### The Problem with Manual Recurring Work

Without Scheduled Tasks, recurring work means:

- ✗ Remember to run the same task daily or weekly
- ✗ Manually trigger the same workflow repeatedly
- ✗ Risk forgetting to run important tasks
- ✗ Inconsistent timing and quality
- ✗ Distraction from important work

#### The Scheduled Tasks Solution

With Scheduled Tasks, you get:

- ✓ **Automation** — Tasks run automatically at set times
- ✓ **Consistency** — Same time, same quality, every execution
- ✓ **Reliability** — Never miss a deadline or update
- ✓ **Time savings** — Reclaim hours per week
- ✓ **Focus** — Stop thinking about repetitive work

### Quick Start: Three Ways to Use Scheduled Tasks

#### One-Time Task (Tomorrow)

**Ask Neuro:**

```
"Run this task tomorrow at 9 AM: 
Research top AI news from the past 24 hours 
and email me a summary"
```

**When to use:** Tasks that need to happen later today or tomorrow, but not recurring.

#### Recurring Task (Weekly)

**Ask Neuro:**

```
"Every Monday at 8 AM, research our top 5 competitors 
and send me a summary of any product updates or news 
from the past week"
```

**When to use:** Regular weekly tasks like competitor monitoring, report generation, or updates.

#### Complex Schedule (Monthly)

**Ask Neuro:**

```
"On the 1st of every month, analyze our website traffic data, 
create a report with key insights, and post it to our Notion database"
```

**When to use:** Monthly reports, billing cycles, or regular complex analysis.

### When to Use Scheduled Tasks

#### Perfect Use Cases ✅

**Recurring Research:**

- Daily news summaries on your industry
- Weekly competitor product updates
- Monthly market trend analysis
- Real-time mentions and social listening

**Regular Reports:**

- Daily sales metrics and pipeline updates
- Weekly team performance summaries
- Monthly analytics and KPI reports
- Quarterly business reviews

**Periodic Data Collection:**

- Daily price tracking for competitors
- Weekly job posting monitoring
- Monthly expense tracking and analysis
- Continuous product review aggregation

**Automated Monitoring:**

- Check for competitor updates weekly
- Monitor market changes daily
- Track industry news and announcements
- Watch for regulatory or policy changes

#### Not Suitable For ❌

**Immediate One-Off Tasks:**

- Don't use Scheduled Tasks for tasks you need right now
- Just run them manually instead

**Real-Time Monitoring:**

- Scheduled Tasks run at specific times, not continuously
- If you need constant monitoring, consider a different approach

**Time-Sensitive Responses:**

- Tasks require time to execute (usually 5-30 minutes)
- Not suitable for instant alerts or notifications

### Real-World Scheduled Task Examples

#### Example 1: Daily News Digest

**Purpose:** Stay informed on industry news without manual research

**Task Name:** "Daily AI News Summary"

**Configuration:**

- Include source citations
- Keep to 2-minute read time"
```

**Output Format:**

- Email subject: "[DATE] AI Industry News Summary"
- 5 key bullets with links
- Include sources with publication names

**Expected Result:** Every weekday morning, a curated 5-bullet AI news summary in your inbox before work starts.

#### Example 2: Weekly Competitor Tracking

**Purpose:** Stay aware of competitor moves and market changes

**Task Name:** "Weekly Competitor Intelligence"

**Configuration:**

```

**Expected Result:** Every Friday evening, a comprehensive competitive intelligence update covering all monitored competitors.

#### Example 3: Monthly Analytics Report

**Purpose:** Regular performance tracking and insights

**Task Name:** "Monthly Website Analytics"

**Configuration:**

- Schedule: 1st of every month at 9 AM
- Assigned Persona: "Data Analyst"

**Task Details:**

```
"Analyze website traffic from last month.

Data to Include:
- Monthly visitor trends (vs. previous month)
- Top 10 pages by traffic

Post to: Slack #marketing channel
Include: Month-over-month comparisons"
```

**Expected Result:** On the 1st of each month, a comprehensive analytics dashboard with insights and recommendations posted to your marketing team.

### How to Set Up Scheduled Tasks

#### Step 1: Describe the Task Clearly

Be specific about what you want the agent to do. Vague descriptions lead to vague results.

❌ **Too Vague:**

```
"Monitor competitors daily"
```

✅ **Specific:**

```
"Every weekday at 9 AM, check these 5 competitors 
for: product updates, pricing changes, job postings, 
and press releases. Create a comparison table 
and email me the results."
```

#### Step 2: Specify the Schedule

Define exactly when and how often the task should run:

**Daily Options:**

- "Every day at 9 AM"
- "Every weekday at 8 AM"
- "Every weekday and Saturday at 6 AM"

**Weekly Options:**

- "Every Monday at 8 AM"
- "Every Friday at 5 PM"
- "Every Tuesday and Thursday at 2 PM"

**Monthly Options:**

- "On the 1st of every month at 9 AM"
- "On the 15th and 30th of every month"
- "Last Friday of every month at 4 PM"

**One-Time Options:**

- "Tomorrow at 3 PM"
- "Next Wednesday at 10 AM"
- "In 2 hours"

#### Step 3: Define the Output

Specify how you want the results delivered:

**Email Output:**

```
"Email me a summary at [your-email@company.com]"
```

**Slack Integration:**

```
"Post results to #marketing channel"
"Send me a Slack DM with the summary"
"Post to multiple channels: #sales and #leadership"
```

**Google Drive:**

```
"Save as a spreadsheet to my 'Reports' folder"
"Create a presentation and save to shared team drive"
"Update existing document with latest data"
```

**Notion Integration:**

```
"Add results to my Notion database"
"Update the monthly analytics page"
"Create a new Notion page with findings"
```

**Multiple Outputs:**

```
"Email me a summary AND post to Slack #leadership"
"Create a report, save to Drive, and post to Notion"
```

#### Step 4: Assign the Right Persona

Connect the task to a custom Persona that has relevant expertise:

**Persona Assignment Examples:**

- Daily News Task → "Industry Analyst" Persona
- Competitor Research → "Competitive Intelligence Officer" Persona
- Analytics Report → "Data Analyst" Persona
- Social Media Monitoring → "Social Media Manager" Persona
- Content Curation → "Content Curator" Persona
- Financial Analysis → "Financial Analyst" Persona

### Managing Your Scheduled Tasks

#### View Active Schedules

Navigate to Settings → Scheduled Tasks to see all your active schedules:

**Dashboard View Shows:**

- ✓ Task name and description
- ✓ Assigned Persona
- ✓ Schedule (when it runs)
- ✓ Output destination
- ✓ Last execution time
- ✓ Next scheduled execution
- ✓ Execution status (success/error)
- ✓ Task execution history

#### Pause a Schedule

Temporarily disable a schedule without deleting it:

**Use Cases:**

- During vacation (pause daily reports)
- Holiday periods (stop competitor monitoring)
- Temporary pause (resume after project)
- Seasonal tasks (pause in off-season)

#### Edit a Schedule

Modify any aspect of an active schedule:

**What You Can Change:**

- ✓ Schedule timing (frequency, time of day)
- ✓ Task description or requirements
- ✓ Output method or destination
- ✓ Assigned Persona
- ✓ Data sources or parameters

#### Delete a Schedule

Remove schedules you no longer need:

**Before Deleting:**

- ⚠️ Confirm you don't need historical data
- ⚠️ Check if downstream processes depend on it
- ⚠️ Consider pausing instead of deleting

#### View Execution History

See past runs, results, and any errors:

**Execution History Shows:**

- ✓ Date and time of execution
- ✓ Task completion status (success/failed)
- ✓ Output delivered (email/Slack/Drive/etc.)
- ✓ Execution duration
- ✓ Any error messages
- ✓ Download past results
- ✓ Re-run a specific execution

### Best Practices for Scheduled Tasks

#### 1. Be Specific About Timing ✅

❌ **Vague:**

```
"In the morning"
"When you get a chance"
```

✅ **Specific:**

```
"Every weekday at 8 AM EST"
"Every Monday at 9:00 AM Pacific"
"On the 1st of the month at 6 AM UTC"
```

**Why it matters:** Vague timing leads to inconsistent execution. Specific times ensure predictable, reliable automation.

#### 2. Define Clear Outputs ✅

❌ **Unclear:**

```
"Let me know what you find"
"Send me something about competitors"
```

✅ **Clear:**

```
"Email me a 5-bullet summary to [email@company.com]"
"Post a comparison table to Slack #competitive-intel"
"Create a slide deck and save to Google Drive /Reports folder"
```

**Why it matters:** Clear output specifications ensure you get results in the format you need.

#### 3. Include Time Ranges for Research ✅

❌ **Ambiguous:**

```
"Research recent news"
"Find new information"
```

✅ **Specific:**

```
"News from the past 24 hours only"
"Updates since last week's report"
"New developments from last 30 days"
"Products released in the past month"
```

**Why it matters:** Time ranges prevent duplicate research and ensure fresh, relevant data.

#### 4. Test Before Scheduling ✅

**Testing Process:**

1. **Step 1:** Run the task manually once
   - → Ask Neuro to execute the task now
2. **Step 2:** Review the output
   - → Check format, quality, and completeness
3. **Step 3:** Make adjustments
   - → Request changes to the description
4. **Step 4:** Then schedule it
   - → Once you're happy, set up the schedule

**Why it matters:** Testing prevents surprises when the task runs automatically.

#### 5. Set Realistic Time Expectations ✅

**Typical Execution Times:**

**Simple tasks: 3-5 minutes**

- News summary
- Price tracking
- Basic research

**Medium tasks: 5-15 minutes**

- Competitor analysis
- Market research
- Report compilation

**Complex tasks: 15-30 minutes**

- Deep analysis
- Multiple data sources
- Comprehensive reports

**Scheduling tip:** Schedule complex tasks at times when you don't need immediate results.
