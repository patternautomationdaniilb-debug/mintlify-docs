## Overview

**Tool Configuration** allows you to enable, disable, and manage individual capabilities for your agents. Choose exactly which tools each agent needs, nothing more, nothing less.

This ensures:

- **Focused agents** — Each agent has only needed capabilities
- **Security** — No unnecessary access to external services
- **Performance** — Faster execution with fewer tools
- **Cost control** — Pay only for what you use
- **29 tools available** — Enable what you need (soon will be more)

---

## Tool Configuration Best Practices

### ✅ Do's

```
✓ Enable only needed tools
  Focused agents are more reliable

✓ Check current config before updating
  Use get_current_agent_config first

✓ Request user confirmation for destructive actions
  Always ask before deleting or major changes

✓ Use batch operations
  Faster than individual calls
  Multiple files, tasks, searches at once

✓ Monitor long operations
  Use wait_for_call_completion, get_actor_run_status

✓ Provide clickable options
  follow_up_answers when asking users

✓ Attach files when sharing results
  Never share about files without attaching them

✓ Mark tasks complete immediately
  After each task finishes
```

### ❌ Don'ts

```
✗ Don't enable unnecessary tools
  Adds complexity, increases costs

✗ Don't delete without confirmation
  Always ask user first

✗ Don't use old parameter names
  Use EXACTLY the specified names

✗ Don't pass JSON strings for arrays
  Pass actual array objects

✗ Don't run canvas operations in parallel
  One at a time only (race conditions)

✗ Don't skip extraction after Apify runs
  Always use get_actor_run_results

✗ Don't assume file indexing complete
  Use ls_kb to check status

✗ Don't proceed without user confirmation
  Especially for destructive operations
```

## Configuration Workflow

### Step 1: Define Agent Purpose

```
What will this agent do?
Example: "Research market trends and create reports"
```

### Step 2: Identify Needed Tools

```
What tools are necessary?
Example: Web Search, Research, Presentations, Files
```

### Step 3: Get Current Config

```
Check what's already enabled
Use get_current_agent_config
```

### Step 4: Update Configuration

```
Add needed tools
Use update_agent with new tool list
```

### Step 5: Test Agent

```
Try agent with simple task
Verify all needed tools work
Adjust if necessary
```

---

## Tool Parameter Reference

### Critical Parameter Rules

```
ALWAYS use EXACT parameter names:
- Typos cause failures
- Refer to each tool's documentation
- Example: "confirm" not "confirmation"

Array vs String:
- Queries: Pass as array [query1, query2]
- NOT as JSON string "[query1, query2]"
- num_results: Pass as integer 5
- NOT as string "5"

File paths:
- Relative to /workspace
- Example: 'src/main.py' not '/workspace/src/main.py'
- Shell commands: Use /workspace path

Batch operations:
- Pass multiple items in single call
- Faster than sequential calls
- Check tool documentation for batch support
```

---

## Security & Permissions

### Tool Access Control

```
Restrict tools by agent role:

Sales Agent:
- Web Search (research)
- Browser (company research)
- NOT: Voice Calls (if not needed)

Support Agent:
- Task Management
- File Reader
- Knowledge Base
- NOT: Presentations (if not needed)

Marketing Agent:
- Presentations
- Image Generation
- Web Search
- Social Media tools
```

### Credential Management

```
Each tool may require authentication:
1. Create credential profile
2. User completes OAuth flow
3. Configure profile for agent
4. Agent can now use that service

Example: Slack, Gmail, GitHub integrations
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Parameter not found"

```
Check exact parameter name
Typos cause failures
Refer to tool documentation
```

### "Array expected, string provided"

```
Don't pass JSON strings for arrays
Pass actual array objects
Example: ["query1", "query2"] not "['query1', 'query2']"
```

### "File not found"

```
Check file path
Relative to /workspace
Use /workspace/ prefix in shell commands
```

### "Tool not enabled"

```
Add tool to agent configuration
Use get_current_agent_config
Use update_agent to enable
```

### "File still indexing"

```
Large files take time to index
Use ls_kb to check status
Try again in a moment
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Choose Your Agent Type

```
Sales, Marketing, Research, Support, etc.
```

### 2. Identify Necessary Tools

```
What will agent actually need?
```

### 3. Enable Tools

```
Use update_agent to add tools
```

### 4. Test Configuration

```
Try agent with sample task
Verify all tools work
```

### 5. Deploy

```
Agent ready for production use
```

## FAQ

**Can I enable all tools?**\
Technically yes, but not recommended. Focused agents are more reliable and cost-effective, but Super Agent from NeuroAI has all tools on.

**Can I change tools later?**\
Yes. Use update_agent anytime to add/remove tools.

**Do I pay for unused tools?**\
Depends on the tool. Some charge per use, others are free. Check pricing.

**How do I test a tool?**\
Create test task that uses that tool. Monitor for errors or unexpected behavior.

**Can tool access be restricted?**\
Yes, through credential profiles and configuration. Some tools require authentication.

**What if a tool fails?**\
Check error message. Usually parameter or authentication issue. Verify configuration.

**Can multiple agents share credentials?**\
Yes. Create credential profile once, configure for multiple agents.

**How do I remove a tool?**\
Use update_agent to remove from configuration.
