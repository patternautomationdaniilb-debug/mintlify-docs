**Super Agent** is Neuro's most powerful General Agent. It's an autonomous AI assistant that can handle virtually any task you throw at it.

**Main Platform Executor** that:

- Works faster, better quality, and more scalable than competing solutions
- Capable of autonomously planning and executing complex action chains
- Manages other AI agents as a single control center
- Intelligently delegates tasks to the most suitable agents
- Synthesizes outputs from all agents into a unified result

### **Vibe Tasking**

A concept that allows users to convey a "vibe" (intention, idea, context), and the platform automatically executes the full work cycle from planning to results.

### **Dynamic Planner (Planning Module)**

A dynamic planner that helps plan and divide tasks into subtasks. Analyzes processes and builds an implementation plan for the task.

**Capabilities:**

- Breaks down complex tasks into logical step sequences
- Coordinates execution among multiple agents
- Adapts the plan in real-time based on results

### **Contextual Workspace (Virtual Workspace)**

A contextual workspace where all information is stored:

- **Memory** — short-term and long-term
- **Personal preferences** — how to better understand and analyze the user
- **All project data** — files, context, history
