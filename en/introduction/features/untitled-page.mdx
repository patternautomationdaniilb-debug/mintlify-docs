## Key technologies and capabilities

### Northstar LLM

Our proprietary large language model, trained on specific business data through simulations in virtual worlds on Google supercomputers. Performance comparable to Gemini 3.0.

**Technical specifications:**

- Trained using advanced reinforcement learning algorithms
- Optimized for audit and financial analysis tasks
- **96.8% accuracy** on FinQA benchmark

### Super agent (the most powerful Agent)

The platform's main executor, which:

- Works faster, better, and more scalably than competing solutions
- Capable of autonomously planning and executing complex action chains
- Manages other AI agents as a unified control center
- Intelligently delegates tasks to the most suitable agents
- Synthesizes outputs from all agents into a unified result

### Vibe tasking

A concept allowing users to convey the "vibe" (intention, idea, context), and the platform automatically executes the full work cycle from planning to result.

### Dynamic planner

A dynamic planner that helps plan and divide tasks into subtasks. Analyzes processes and builds an implementation plan.

**Capabilities:**

- Breaks down complex tasks into logical step sequences
- Coordinates execution among multiple agents
- Adapts the plan in real-time based on results

### Contextual workspace

A contextual workspace where all information is stored:

- **Memory** — short-term and long-term
- **Personal preferences** — how to better understand and analyze the user
- **All project data** — files, context, history

## Modular architecture

Neuro AI is built on a sophisticated modular architecture, where each module performs a specific function. Together, these modules ensure the system operates as a true autonomous agent.

### Key modules

Once the goal is defined, Neuro AI's engine:

- Breaks the task into a logical sequence of steps
- Executes these steps using various agents and tools
- Works without constant user input

### Multi-agent collaboration

Neuro AI uses a team of specialized AI agents:

- **Research agent** — gathering information from the web
- **Data analysis agent** — processing information
- **Content generation agent** — composing reports
- Agents work in coordination, passing information and results to each other

### Integrated toolset

The virtual workspace includes:

- Web browser for interacting with sites
- Code editor for writing and running programs
- File system for working with documents
- Ability to interact with the digital world like a human

### Persistent memory

Unlike many AI models with limited context windows:

- Long-term memory system
- Remembers past interactions
- Stores user preferences
- Remembers project details across multiple sessions
- Learns and adapts over time

### Real-time monitoring

- Transparent view of system operations
- Ability to track progress in real-time
- User can intervene and provide feedback

## Technical performance metrics

<Info>
  **Measurable performance indicators:**

  - **Sub-2-second latency** for complex queries
  - **96.8% on FinQA benchmark**
</Info>

These quantitative metrics build trust and confirm enterprise-level solution.

## Key differences from competitors

### What makes Neuro AI a true AI agent

<Note>
  **Four key capabilities of a true AI agent:**

  **1. Perceives the world** — sees, hears, reads, and analyzes the environment. Processes text, images, video, and data from multiple sources.

  **2. Understands context** — doesn't just react to keywords, but understands the full task context, including goals, constraints, and connections between information.

  **3. Makes decisions based on experience and memory** — maintains short-term and long-term memory, learns from past interactions, and applies knowledge to new situations.

  **4. Acts autonomously** — calls APIs, sends emails, manages software, controls systems, and executes complex workflows without step-by-step instructions.
</Note>

### From conversation to action

**Alternatives:**

Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity — require lots of copy-paste and manual work

**Our advantages:**

**1. Agent-first**

The user interacts with a single intelligent agent, which is the main entry point for solving any task.

**2. Intent-to-action**

The system can transform high-level natural language requests ("create a portfolio website", "analyze sales report") into a complex sequence of actions without the need for step-by-step instructions.

**3. True autonomy**

Neuro AI can work independently for extended periods, processing complex long-term tasks in the background, freeing users for strategic work.

**4. A workforce of agents**

This isn't one AI — it's a team of AI working together. The multi-agent approach provides a more powerful and flexible problem-solving model.

**5. Transparency and control**

The ability to monitor AI work and intervene when necessary builds trust and ensures the user remains in control of the process.

**6. Intelligence beyond imitation**

While RAG systems imitate knowledge and voice assistants imitate reactions, Neuro AI demonstrates true capabilities for reasoning, planning, and adaptation.

<Warning>
  **The main difference:**

  We didn't want to build another chatbot. We wanted to democratize AI power for ordinary people, without requiring them to be engineers or programmers. You simply set a task — the system determines the execution plan and follows it step by step in **fully autonomous mode**.

  Neuro AI isn't built to help people work faster — it's built to **work instead of people**, automating entire workflows from start to finish.
