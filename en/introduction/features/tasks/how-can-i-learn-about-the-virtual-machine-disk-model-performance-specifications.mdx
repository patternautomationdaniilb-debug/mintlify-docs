The performance of our virtual machine is not fixed and will be dynamically adjusted based on the scale of the business and the usage by online users, so we are unable to provide detailed information.

Additionally, we previously noticed user feedback regarding the sandbox disk space being too small, which caused tasks to fail. We have already expanded the disk space, so in your future usage, you should no longer encounter limitations caused by insufficient disk space.
