## **Understanding Sandbox Issues**

The sandbox is the isolated virtual environment where Manus executes your tasks. Occasionally, you may experience connection issues or temporary disconnections from the sandbox. This article explains how these issues are managed and what happens to your work.

## **Automatic Sandbox Reset**

If you experience a prolonged sandbox disconnection and cannot reconnect for an extended period, the sandbox will be automatically reset to restore normal functionality. This automatic reset is a safety mechanism to ensure the system remains stable and responsive.

## **Sandbox Inactivity Reset Policy**

Manus also implements an inactivity-based reset policy to optimize resource usage:

- **Free Users:** Your sandbox will be automatically reset after 7 days of **non-use.**
- **Paid Users:** Your sandbox will be automatically reset after 14 days of **non-use.**

This allows us to maintain system performance while giving paid users extended access to their sandboxes.

## **Task Progress Protection**

Important: Sandbox resets do not affect your task progress. Your task data and work history remain intact even after the sandbox is reset. You can continue working on your tasks without losing any information.

## **What if Task Progress is Lost?**

In the rare event that task progress is lost after a sandbox reset, please contact our support team immediately through the **Help Centre AI chatbot,** and our team will investigate the issue. Currently, resetting will inevitably result in file loss, as it requires launching a new sandbox due to sandbox virtual machine abnormalities. All files within the sandbox will be lost in this process.
