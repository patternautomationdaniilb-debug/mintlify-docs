## Overview

Scheduled Tasks let you automate recurring work. Instead of manually running the same task repeatedly, configure Neuro to execute it on a schedule:

- **Execute on schedule** — Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom schedules
- **Automate recurring work** — Research, reporting, monitoring, analysis
- **Save time** — Eliminate hours of repetitive manual work
- **Deliver consistently** — Same quality, same time, every execution
- **24/7 automation** — Tasks run around the clock without intervention

---

## Quick Start

### Simple Request

```
Ask Neuro:
"Run this task tomorrow at 9 AM: 
Research top AI news from the past 24 hours 
and email me a summary"
```

### Recurring Request

```
Ask Neuro:
"Every Monday at 8 AM, research our top 5 competitors 
and send me a summary of any product updates or news 
from the past week"
```

### Complex Schedule

✓ Use clear time zones "9 AM EST" not "9 AM"

✓ Test before scheduling Run manually first, verify, then schedule

✓ Monitor execution Check history for errors regularly

✓ Document the purpose Why is this task needed?

✓ Keep it reasonable Don't schedule too many at once

```

### ❌ Don'ts
```

✗ Don't be vague "Tomorrow" without time "News" without scope

✗ Don't forget to test Schedule without manual verification

✗ Don't ignore failures Monitor execution history

✗ Don't leave old tasks running Clean up obsolete tasks

✗ Don't schedule during peak times Avoid 9-10 AM, 4-5 PM

✗ Don't overload the system Space out heavy tasks
