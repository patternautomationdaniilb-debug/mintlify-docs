Neuro AI is a multi-agent platform created to liberate people and businesses from routine tasks. It's not just a tool, but a full-fledged AI Co-Agent (Co-Worker), a "Jarvis" for the modern professional, taking on complex tasks from creating presentations and analyzing data to managing content and automating marketing. Let's vibe tasking together!

It’s different from traditional workflow automations. You don’t need to map every step, tinker with if-this-then-that branching, or babysit dependencies. You just give it feedback like you would a teammate, and the agent learns using its memory. It’s built from the ground up as an agent, with the ability to plan and iterate until it gets the job done, or seek permission before executing sensitive tasks.

## Key characteristics

### **Build Your Own Workforce**

Customize your AI “agents” (workers) according to your industry or personal workflow needs. You have full control to create specialized Agent with persona, knowledge base, toolkits, tasks and apps, assembling a workforce tailored to you.

### **Dynamic Multi-Agent Collaboration**

Neuro dynamically breaks down tasks and activates multiple agents to work, automating complex tasks much faster than traditional single-agent sequential workflows. This parallelism accelerates execution and handles flexible, multi-step scenarios with ease.

### **Human-in-the-Loop**

If a task gets stuck or encounters uncertainty, Neuro will automatically request human input. This safety net ensures critical decisions or errors are handled with human oversight, improving reliability.

- **500+ Apps/MCP integrations** — works with Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, GitHub, Notion, LinkedIn, Instagram, and hundreds of other services
- **Unified control center** for all workflows
- **Platform with a Super Agent inside**, managing other AI agents and having most powerful tools.

### The main problem we solve

An enormous amount of time goes into mechanical work — creating content, analyzing data, managing projects — instead of working on strategy and development. Great ideas and ambitions, but routine drains energy and leads to burnout.

Many have used ChatGPT for communication. They had countless copy-pastes: different presentations, Google sheets, meetings, data analysis, scraping, a bunch of different applications and multiple subscriptions.

### Our solution

Neuro AI is the way to solve this problem once and for all. It's a place where pure productivity is born. Where tasks close themselves, and processes work like clockwork.

<Note>
  **Innovation is what you refuse**

  True innovation is not adding new features, but liberation from routine and everything unnecessary. When the platform takes on mechanical tasks, you get the opportunity to refuse endless copy-pastes, switching between applications and multiple subscriptions — and focus on what truly matters.

  This is the key product idea: **transformation through refusing routine**.
