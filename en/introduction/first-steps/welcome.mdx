Manus AI is an autonomous general AI agent designed to complete tasks and deliver results. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply answer questions, Manus AI takes action. Think of Manus AI as a virtual colleague with its own computer,capable of planning, executing, and delivering complete work products from start to finish.

\*\*What Makes Manus AI Different?\*\*Traditional AI tools require constant supervision and manual intervention. You guide them step by step, then piece together the results yourself. **Manus AI works differently**. It operates in a complete sandbox environment—a virtual computer with internet access, a persistent file system, and the ability to install software and create custom tools. This means Manus AI can work independently, remember context across long tasks, and deliver production-ready results without you managing every detail.
