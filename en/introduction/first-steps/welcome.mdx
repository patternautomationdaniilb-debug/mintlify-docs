Neuro AI is the world’s first multi-agent platforman or MAS (a [multi-agent system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-agent_system)) with many autonomous custom general AI agents designed to complete tasks and deliver results.

Unlike traditional chatbots (ChatGPT, Qwen...) or Agents on N8N/Make (RAG Agents and others) that simply answer questions or do hardly created automations, Neuro AI takes action without any hard knowleadge to set up.

Think of Neuro AI as a virtual office with all colleagues with their own computer,capable of planning, executing, and delivering complete work products from start to finish.

What Makes Neuro AI Different?

Traditional AI tools require constant supervision and manual intervention. You guide them step by step, then piece together the results yourself. **Neuro AI works differently**. It operates in a complete virtual environment—a virtual computer with internet access, a persistent file system, and the ability to install software and create custom tools. This means Neuro AI can work independently, remember context across long tasks, and deliver production-ready results without you managing every detail.
