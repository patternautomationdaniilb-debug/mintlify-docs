# **What is a connector?**

Connectors are a user-centric integration layer that enables Manus to securely access your third-party data and APIs (including MCP servers) and execute workflows directly in conversations.

This system abstracts external services into unified tools and data models while providing permission and cost control.

With connectors, you can access, search, and interact with external tools and data directly within Manus. This streamlines your workflow and centralizes operations.

Manus imports relevant information from these connected sources to better understand your needs and deliver more personalized AI experiences—all without requiring you to switch between applications.

Typical implementations include:

- Gmail/Google Calendar integration for automated email summarization, response drafting, and schedule management
- GitHub/Linear/[monday.com](http://monday.com) integration for streamlined issue management, automated release notes, and systematic project reporting
- Natural language interface for Supabase/Postgres (Prisma, Neon) database queries, providing real-time access to product metrics and analytics

These integrations work together in a secure environment, giving you quick access to your data and tools. This setup helps you work more efficiently by reducing context-switching, while still keeping your information safe.

# **How can I start using a connector?**

1. Select your favorite app to connect with and click "+ Connect"
2. Authenticate by logging in to your app account
   - Note that some connectors require additional configuration, such as a personal API token. Please follow the specific instructions for your chosen connector.
3. Upon successful connection, you will see a pop-up notification stating "Successfully installed connector."
4. You can now start using the connector with Manus

# **What happens when I remove a connector?**

When you remove a connector, all login information and saved credentials are cleared. You'll need to connect the connector again and log in to resume using it.

# **How do I switch accounts for a connector?**

You can easily switch to a different account. Simply select your connector and click "Manage" → "Configure". This will initiate a re-authentication process where you can select a different account or workspace for the connector.

# **What if I cannot find the connector I want?**

You can create your own custom API connector or MCP connector. Simply follow the provided instructions to enter the required information.

# **What if I share my session link with someone? Will they be able to see the data or API keys from the connector?**

Manus protects your privacy by hiding connector output in shared sessions and automatically redacting sensitive information like API keys. However, please remain cautious about what content you choose to share.

# **Troubleshooting GitHub Connection Issues**

If you encounter problems connecting to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [**<u>Integrations settings page</u>**](https://github.com/settings/installations) on GitHub
2. Uninstall the Manus Connector app from your GitHub account.
3. Return to [**<u>Manus.im</u>**](http://Manus.im)** **and set up the connection again.
