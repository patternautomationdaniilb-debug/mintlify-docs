## What is an App?

App are a user-centric integration layer that enables Neuro to securely access your third-party data and APIs (including MCP servers) and execute workflows directly in conversations.

This system abstracts external services into unified tools and data models while providing permission and cost control.

With apps/connectors, you can access, search, and interact with external tools and data directly within Neuro. This streamlines your workflow and centralizes operations.

Neuro imports relevant information from these connected sources to better understand your needs and deliver more personalized AI experiences—all without requiring you to switch between applications.

Typical implementations include:

- Gmail/Google Calendar integration for automated email summarization, response drafting, and schedule management
- GitHub/Linear/monday.com integration for streamlined issue management, automated release notes, and systematic project reporting
- Natural language interface for Supabase/Postgres (Prisma, Neon) database queries, providing real-time access to product metrics and analytics(soon)

These apps/integrations work together in a secure environment, giving you quick access to your data and tools. This setup helps you work more efficiently by reducing context-switching, while still keeping your information safe.

## How can I start using an app?

1. Select your favorite app to connect with and click "+ Connect"
2. Authenticate by logging in to your app account
   - Note that some connectors require additional configuration, such as a personal API token. Please follow the specific instructions for your chosen connector.
3. Upon successful connection, you will see a pop-up notification stating "Successfully installed app/connector."
4. You can now start using the apps with Neuro

### What happens when I remove an apps?

When you remove an app, all login information and saved credentials are cleared. You'll need to connect the app again and log in to resume using it.

### How do I switch accounts for an app?

You can easily switch to a different account. Simply select your app and click "Manage" → "Configure". This will initiate a re-authentication process where you can select a different account or workspace for the app.

### What if I cannot find the app/connector I want?

You can create your own custom API connector or MCP connector. Simply follow the provided instructions to enter the required information.

### What if I share my session link with someone? Will they be able to see the data or API keys from the app/connector?

Neuro protects your privacy by hiding apps/connector output in shared sessions and automatically redacting sensitive information like API keys. However, please remain cautious about what content you choose to share.
