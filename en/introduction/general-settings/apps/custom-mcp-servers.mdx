### What are Custom MCP Servers/Apps?

Custom MCP servers/Apps allow you to extend Neuro’s integration capabilities beyond prebuilt connectors. If your organization uses internal tools, proprietary APIs, or specialized services not covered by standard MCP connectors/Apps, you can build a custom server that connects Neuro to those systems. A custom MCP server/Apps acts as a bridge between Neuro and your internal infrastructure, enabling the same seamless multi-app workflows you get with prebuilt connectors—but tailored to your specific tools and requirements.

**Why Build Custom MCP Servers/Apps?**

**Internal Systems**

Many organizations rely on custom-built tools, internal databases, or proprietary software. Custom MCP/Apps servers allow Neuro to integrate with these systems, bringing internal data into your AI workflows.

**Examples**:

- Internal CRM or customer database
- Proprietary project management tools
- Custom analytics platforms
- Legacy systems with APIs

**Specialized Services**

Some third-party services don’t have prebuilt MCP connectors. If you use a specialized tool or niche service, you can build a custom server to connect it to Neuro.

**Examples**:

- Industry-specific software
- Regional services not covered by standard connectors
- Emerging platforms without official integrations

**Custom Business Logic**

Custom MCP servers/ Apps can implement business-specific logic, data transformations, or validation rules that go beyond simple API calls. This allows you to enforce organizational policies and workflows within Apps integrations.

**Examples**:

- Approval workflows before data updates
- Data validation against internal standards
- Custom authentication or security requirements
- Multi-step processes specific to your organization

**How Custom MCP Servers Work**

A custom MCP server is a lightweight service that implements the Model Context Protocol specification. It exposes endpoints that Neuro can call to read data, perform actions, or execute custom logic within your systems.

**Architecture Your Internal System**↔**Custom MCP Server**↔**NeuroAI**

The MCP server sits between Neuro and your internal systems, translating Neuro requests into actions within your tools and returning results in a format Neuro understands.

**Protocol**

Custom MCP servers implement a standardized protocol that defines:

- **Tools**: Actions Neuro can perform (e.g., “get_customer_data”, “update_project_status”)
- **Resources**: Data Neuro can read (e.g., documents, records, files)
- **Prompts**: Predefined templates for common operations

**Building a Custom MCP Server/Apps**

**Prerequisites**

- **API access** to the system you want to integrate
- **Development environment** (Node.js, Python, or any language that can run a web server)
- **Understanding of the MCP specification/apps** (available in Neuro documentation)

**Basic Implementation**

A minimal custom MCP server/Apps includes:

1. **Server endpoint**: A web service that responds to MCP protocol requests
2. **Tool definitions**: Descriptions of actions Neuro can perform
3. **Authentication**: Secure handling of credentials and API keys
4. **Request handlers**: Logic that executes actions and returns results

**Example: Internal CRM Integration**

Here’s a conceptual example of a custom MCP server for an internal CRM:

**Tools exposed**:

- `get_customer_info(customer_id)`: Retrieve customer details
- `update_customer_notes(customer_id, notes)`: Add notes to customer record
- `search_customers(query)`: Search customer database
- `create_follow_up_task(customer_id, task_description, due_date)`: Create task

**Authentication**: API key or OAuth token for your internal CRM

**Deployment**: Hosted on your infrastructure or a secure cloud environment

Once deployed, you connect this custom server to Neuro, and it appears alongside prebuilt connectors. You can then use natural language prompts like:

- “Get customer information for customer ID 12345”
- “Search for customers in the Frankfurt area”
- “Update notes for customer 67890 with our recent conversation”

**Connecting a Custom MCP Server/Apps**

**Step 1: Deploy Your Server**

Host your custom MCP server on infrastructure you control. Ensure it’s accessible via HTTPS and has proper security measures in place.

**Step 2: Add to Neuro**

In Manus, navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Custom MCP Servers/Neuro**

and click

**Add Server**.

**Step 3: Provide Server Details**

Enter the following information:

- **Server name**: A descriptive name (e.g., “Internal CRM”, “Analytics Platform”)
- **Server URL**: The HTTPS endpoint where your MCP server is hosted
- **Authentication**: API key, Bearer token, or other credentials required

**Step 4: Test Connection**

Neuro will verify it can communicate with your server and retrieve the list of available tools.

**Step 5: Start Using**

Once connected, your custom tools appear in Neuro’s available integrations. Reference them in prompts just like prebuilt connectors.

**Security Considerations**

**Authentication**

Custom MCP servers should implement robust authentication:

- Use API keys, OAuth tokens, or other secure methods
- Never expose credentials in URLs or logs
- Rotate credentials regularly

**Authorization**

Implement proper authorization checks:

- Verify that the requesting user has permission to access data
- Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) if applicable
- Log all access attempts for audit purposes[**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#data-transmission)

**Data Transmission**

- Use HTTPS for all communication
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

### [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#network-security)

**Network Security**

- Deploy MCP servers within your secure network perimeter
- Use firewalls and access controls to restrict who can reach the server
- Consider VPN or private network connections for highly sensitive integrations

## [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#best-practices)

**Best Practices**

### [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#tool-design)

**Tool DesignKeep tools focused**: Each tool should perform one clear action. Instead of a single “manage_customer” tool, create separate tools for “get_customer”, “update_customer”, “delete_customer”.**Provide clear descriptions**: Manus uses tool descriptions to understand when to use each tool. Write clear, specific descriptions that explain what the tool does and when it’s appropriate.**Handle errors gracefully**: Return meaningful error messages that help Manus (and users) understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

### [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#performance)

**PerformanceOptimize response times**: Manus waits for MCP server responses. Keep operations fast by caching data, using efficient queries, and avoiding unnecessary processing.**Implement timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts for API calls to prevent Manus from waiting indefinitely if your internal system is slow or unresponsive.**Use async operations for long tasks**: If an operation takes more than a few seconds, consider returning immediately with a task ID and providing a separate tool to check status.

### [**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/custom-mcp#monitoring)

**MonitoringLog all requests**: Track what Manus is requesting and how your server responds. This helps with debugging and understanding usage patterns.**Monitor performance**: Track response times, error rates, and usage volume to identify issues before they impact users.**Set up alerts**: Get notified if your MCP server becomes unresponsive or starts returning errors.
