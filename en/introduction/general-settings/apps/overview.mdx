Use Manus from your favorite apps

Integrations bring Manus into your existing workflow tools. Instead of switching to the Manus app, you can create tasks, receive notifications, and interact with Manus directly from platforms like Slack, Zapier, and more.**Use cases:**

- Start Manus tasks from Slack channels or direct messages
- Receive task completion notifications in Slack
- Trigger Manus workflows from Zapier automations
