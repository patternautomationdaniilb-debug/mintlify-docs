## Security & Permissions

✓ Create new items
✓ Update records
✓ Send messages
```

### Confirmation Before Actions

Apps that take write actions require your explicit confirmation:

```
Agent: "I'm about to send a message to 12 team members.

```

This ensures:

- No accidental sends
- You review before execution

## Best Practices

### ✅ Grant Minimal Permissions

Only grant the permissions you actually need.

```
Good:
"Google Drive app can search the 'Shared' folder"

Avoid:
"Google Drive app can access all my files"
```

### ✅ Review Apps Quarterly

Check which apps you're actually using.

```
Questions to ask:
□ What apps am I using?
□ Are there unused apps? (Remove them)
□ Do permissions still make sense?
□ Any security concerns?
```

### ✅ Use Search Before Actions

Get context before taking actions.

```
Better workflow:
1. Search Google Drive for previous analysis
2. Review findings
3. Create new analysis based on findings
4. Then post to team

Avoids errors and provides context.
```

### ✅ Sync Important Reference Material

Pre-index information your agents need to know.

```
Good candidates for sync:
→ Company knowledge base
→ Product documentation
→ Brand guidelines
→ Standard operating procedures

Avoid syncing:
→ Sensitive customer data
→ Frequently changing information
→ Temporary documents
```

### ✅ Combine Apps for Better Results

Chain multiple apps in one conversation.

```
Single app:
"Search Google Drive for competitor reports"

Multiple apps:
"Search Google Drive for competitor reports, 
then deep research their latest funding and 
market positioning"

Result: Much richer analysis
```

## Troubleshooting

### App can't find data

- Reconnect the app (re-authenticate)
- Check data location

---

### Write action not working

**Check:**

---

### Slow response times

**Check:**
