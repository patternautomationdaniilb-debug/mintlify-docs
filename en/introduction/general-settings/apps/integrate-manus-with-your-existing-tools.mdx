## **What are Integrations/Apps?**

Integrations allow Neuro to connect with the tools and services you already use—Gmail, Notion, Stripe, Slack, Google Calendar, and more. Instead of working in isolation, Neuro can read data from your connected apps, perform actions across multiple platforms, and deliver results directly into your existing workflows.Integrations transform Neuro from a standalone AI assistant into a central orchestration layer for your digital workspace. A single prompt can trigger actions across multiple apps, eliminating the need to constantly switch between tools and manually transfer information.

**Types of Integrations**

Neuro offers several integration options to fit different workflows and technical requirements:

**MCP Connectors/Apps**

\*\*Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors \*\*are prebuilt integrations with popular tools and services. These connectors allow Neuro to access your data and perform actions within connected apps using OAuth authentication.

**Available connectors/Neuro include**: Gmail, Notion, Stripe, HubSpot, Slack, Google Calendar, Hugging Face, Google Drive, GitHub, and more.

**Use cases**: Multi-app workflows, automated data synchronization, cross-platform task execution.

**Custom MCP Servers/Apps**

For organizations with internal tools or specialized requirements, Neuro supports custom MCP servers/ Apps. This allows you to build integrations with proprietary systems, internal APIs, or third-party services not covered by prebuilt connectors.

Use cases: Internal CRM systems, custom databases, proprietary APIs, specialized enterprise tools.

\*\*Zapier Integration: \*\*

Connect Neuro to thousands of apps through Zapier, enabling automated workflows that trigger based on events in your connected tools. Use Zapier to create multi-step automations that involve Neuro alongside other services.Use cases: Automated reporting, event-driven task creation, cross-platform notifications.[**​**](https://manus.im/docs/integrations/integrations#manus-api)

\*\*Neuro API \*\*

Access Neuro programmatically through the Neuro API, allowing you to build custom applications, automate workflows, and integrate Neuro into your own software systems.

Use cases: Custom applications, workflow automation, embedded AI capabilities.

**Data Sources**

Access premium third-party data APIs integrated into Neuro, enabling real-time data enrichment for your tasks without managing extra API keys or integrations.

**Use cases**: Market research, financial analysis, social media monitoring, economic data retrieval.

**Why Use Integrations/Apps?**

**Eliminate App-Switching**

Instead of manually copying information between tools, Neuro handles data transfer automatically. A single prompt can read from one app, process the information, and write results to another.

**Unified Workflows**

Integrations allow you to create workflows that span multiple platforms. Update your CRM, send emails, create calendar events, and log tasks—all from a single Neuro prompt.

**Contextual Intelligence**

When Neuro has access to your connected tools, it can use real data from your workflows to provide more accurate and relevant results. No more generic responses — Neuro works with your actual documents, emails, and data.

**Automation at Scale**

Combine integrations with features like Neuro Research and Scheduled Tasks to automate repetitive workflows across multiple platforms. Process hundreds of items, update multiple systems, and maintain synchronization without manual intervention.

**Getting Started**

1. **Choose your integration type** based on your needs (MCP Connectors/ Apps for common tools, Custom MCP for proprietary systems, Zapier for automation, etc.)
2. **Connect your accounts** using OAuth or API keys (depending on integration type)
3. **Test with a simple workflow** to verify the connection works correctly
4. **Build more complex workflows** combining multiple integrations

**Security and Permissions**

All integrations use secure authentication methods (OAuth 2.0 or API keys) and respect the permissions you grant. You can review and revoke access to any integration at any time through your Neuro settings.

Neuro only accesses data you explicitly authorize and uses it solely to complete the tasks you request. Integration connections are personal to your account and not shared with other users unless you explicitly collaborate on a task.
