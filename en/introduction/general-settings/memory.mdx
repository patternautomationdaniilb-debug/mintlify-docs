## Core Memory Feature Overview

### What is Pickle OS Memory?

Pickle OS is positioned as **"One space for every memory"** — a centralized memory system that:

1. **Collects context from every source, every day**
2. **Organizes everything as a single cluster**
3. **Enables AI conversations with full historical context**
4. **Evolves to understand the user better over time**

The memory system is described as "living" because it actively updates, retrieves relevant information, and grows more personalized through continuous interaction.
