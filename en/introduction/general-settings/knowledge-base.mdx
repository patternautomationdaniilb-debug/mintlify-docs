## What is the Knowledge Base?

The **Knowledge Base** is a centralized repository of company information that teaches Neuro about your business. It's like creating a custom AI that understands:

- Your company values and culture
- How you operate and make decisions
- Your products and market positioning
- Your brand voice and messaging
- Your processes and best practices
- Your industry expertise and insights

Instead of generic AI responses, Neuro references your Knowledge Base to deliver business-specific, accurate, contextual answers.

## Why Every Team Needs a Knowledge Base

### Without Knowledge Base

Generic AI that:

```
❌ Doesn't understand your business context
❌ Makes generic recommendations
❌ Inconsistent with your brand voice
❌ Misses industry insights
❌ Requires manual context every request
❌ Can't make informed decisions
❌ Treats all companies the same
```

### With Knowledge Base

Business-aware AI that:

```
✅ Understands your market and strategy
✅ References your actual processes
✅ Maintains consistent brand voice
✅ Makes informed recommendations
✅ Works independently
✅ Improves with feedback
✅ Customized to your business
```

## Best Practices for Knowledge Base Success

### ✅ Do's

```
✓ Be specific and clear
  "Response time: 4 hours, not 'quick'"

✓ Include real examples
  "Here's a real sales email we used"

✓ Keep it current
  Update monthly, remove outdated info

✓ Use consistent format
  Same structure for all documents

✓ Cross-reference related docs
  Link to related information

✓ Assign ownership
  Someone responsible for each section

✓ Add dates
  "Last updated: Jan 15, 2025"

✓ Make it searchable
  Use consistent terminology and tags
```

### ❌ Don'ts

```
✗ Don't leave it vague
  "We focus on customer success" (too vague)

✗ Don't include outdated info
  Remove or clearly mark old information

✗ Don't duplicate information
  Store in one place, link from others

✗ Don't create inconsistent format
  Standardize how you document

✗ Don't forget to update
  Stale knowledge base is worse than none

✗ Don't include everything
  Focus on important business information

✗ Don't store sensitive data
  Avoid PII, financial data, unreleased products

✗ Don't make it too complex
  Keep language clear and simple

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Vague

```
Bad: "We focus on customer satisfaction"

Good: "We aim for 95% CSAT score. 
4-hour response time SLA. 
Daily check-ins for first 30 days."
```

### ❌ Mistake 2: Outdated Information

```
Problem: Old pricing, deprecated products
Solution: Review quarterly, mark update dates,
remove stale info, use version control

Action: Set calendar reminders
```

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Examples

```
Bad: "We provide responsive support"

Good: "We respond to support tickets within 4 hours. 
Example: Ticket submitted 2 PM, response by 6 PM. 
For critical issues, we respond within 1 hour."
```

### ❌ Mistake 4: Too Much Information

```
Problem: Knowledge base becomes unwieldy
Solution: Focus on what matters most, archive old info

Keep:
✓ Strategic information
✓ Processes you use
✓ Market insights
✓ Brand guidelines

Archive:
✗ Experiments that didn't work
✗ Old projects
✗ Outdated processes
✗ Historical information
```

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Ownership

```
Problem: Knowledge base becomes stale
Solution: Assign owner for each section

Approach:
- Assign by domain (Sales owns sales docs)
- Monthly update responsibility
- Quarterly audit
- Accountability for accuracy
```
