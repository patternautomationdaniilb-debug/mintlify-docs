## Part 5: Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

#### Uptime Percentage

```
Uptime = (Total Time - Downtime) / Total Time × 100

Target: 99.9% (allows ~7 hours downtime per month)

99.9% = ~44 minutes downtime per month
99.5% = ~3.6 hours downtime per month
99.0% = ~7.2 hours downtime per month
```

#### Response Time

```
How long it takes Neuro to respond to requests

Optimal: 200-500ms
Acceptable: 500ms-2 seconds
Degraded: 2-10 seconds
Poor: 10+ seconds

Factors affecting response time:
- Request complexity
- System load
- Available resources
- Network conditions
```

#### Success Rate

```
Percentage of requests that complete successfully

Target: 99.9%
Good: 99.0-99.9%
Acceptable: 95-99%
Poor: <95%
```

#### API Rate Limits

```
Number of requests allowed per time period

Standard: 100 requests per minute
Premium: 500 requests per minute
