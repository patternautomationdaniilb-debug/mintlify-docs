# Currently, the user knowledge base is limited to 100 entries for Pro users and 50 entries for Free users. If you encounter issues related to reaching the limit, you can filter the entries in your knowledge base based on your most important and recent needs, and delete some unnecessary entries. In the future, we will continue to optimize the knowledge base functionality based on user needs and feedback.

To ensure the quality of Manus responses, it is recommended that you appropriately streamline the content of your knowledge base and avoid exceeding the limit, as having too many entries may affect the system's response quality.
