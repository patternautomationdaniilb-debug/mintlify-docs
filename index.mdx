Neuro AI is a multi-agent platform created to liberate people and businesses from routine tasks. It's not just a tool, but a full-fledged AI assistant, a "Jarvis" for the modern professional, taking on complex tasks from creating presentations and analyzing data to managing content and automating marketing.

## Key characteristics

- **200+ MCP integrations** — works with Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, GitHub, Notion, LinkedIn, Instagram, and hundreds of other services
- **Unified control center** for all workflows
- **Platform with a super agent inside**, managing other AI agents

## The main problem we solve

An enormous amount of time goes into mechanical work — creating content, analyzing data, managing projects — instead of working on strategy and development. Great ideas and ambitions, but routine drains energy and leads to burnout.

Many have used ChatGPT for communication. They had countless copy-pastes: different presentations, Google sheets, meetings, data analysis, scraping, a bunch of different applications and multiple subscriptions.

### Our solution

Neuro AI is the way to solve this problem once and for all. It's a place where pure productivity is born. Where tasks close themselves, and processes work like clockwork.

<Note>
**Innovation is what you refuse**

True innovation is not adding new features, but liberation from routine and everything unnecessary. When the platform takes on mechanical tasks, you get the opportunity to refuse endless copy-pastes, switching between applications and multiple subscriptions — and focus on what truly matters.

This is the key product idea: **transformation through refusing routine**.
</Note>

## Value proposition

Neuro AI doesn't sell automation, it sells **transformation**. We give users the ability to become **"overachieving Humans"**, not just use "overachieving AI".

The platform frees up time and mental resources, allowing you to focus on creativity, strategy, development, and life outside work. We sell the dream of **Tony Stark's lifestyle**: freedom of choice, focus on what matters, and unlimited growth opportunities.

<Info>
**Concrete results:** Clients save **20-30 hours per week** on routine tasks, allowing them to focus on strategy, creativity, and business development.
